# F-13 Change Requests — Backend + Frontend Implementation Plan

This plan builds the authoring half of EP-13 (FR-55, FR-56, FR-60, FR-68, FR-108, FR-109): the rule that released data is changed only through a change request, now with a way through (US-053); creating, editing and deleting a request of one of six types on a working copy of the released data (MH-39, US-054); the origin and basis document number (US-055); scanned supporting documents (US-056); submitting with automatic routing to the coordinators, program directors and academic office that must approve it, and a preview of who that is (US-057); the conflict warning when another open request targets the same object (US-058); withdrawing (US-059); the organisational request of R2 and R4 that goes straight to the academic office (MH-40, US-060); the request list (MH-38) and the read-only detail page (MH-41).

It deliberately excludes every approval action — approve, return, reject, override, comments, the per-round history view, the "waiting for me" queue (MH-42) and notifications (F-14); final approval, applying a request to released data and creating the new version (MH-43, F-15); the grading-formula request type and the "CLO not assessed" submit block (F-12, after the MVP); importing a curriculum from Excel into a request's working copy (F-09, after the MVP); delegation (B6); and digital signatures (F13-05).

## 0. Plan at a glance

Everything below in one table. Read this; the rest is detail for whoever builds it.

| What | Why | How and where |
|---|---|---|
| **"Tạo đề xuất" opens a request form with the target already chosen** — on every screen that today shows the disabled button | US-053 AC1; FR-55; every earlier plan left the button disabled for F-13 | The shared tooltip becomes a link to MH-39 with `?type=&targetType=&targetId=`; one shared FE helper builds it (FE-07) |
| **A request edits a working copy, never the released data** — a Draft program version or a Draft syllabus revision tied to the request | US-054 AC2; F13-08 | `ProgramVersion.sourceRequestId`, `Syllabus.sourceRequestId`; the copy is made with the existing version copier and a new syllabus copier, then edited in the **existing** curriculum, outcome, program-info and syllabus screens (BE-01, BE-03, FE-05) |
| **The existing screens accept the request's creator on the copy, and only them** | US-054 AC6; BR-23 | One shared guard `assertEditPath` replaces `assertDirectEdit` in the four write guards of F-07, F-08, F-10, F-11; every call site is listed (BE-02) |
| **Course attributes, relations and organisational changes are typed in as items** — no copy to edit | US-053 AC4; US-060 | Item editor on the request: course fields and relation add / change / remove; member add / end, director assign / end (BE-04, FE-04, FE-06) |
| **Seven request types, six for data and one organisational; grading formula greyed out** | FR-56; F13-02, F13-03; F-12 is after the MVP | `ChangeRequestType` enum; R2 and R4 may create only `ORGANIZATION`; creating a data request needs edit permission on the target (BE-03) |
| **Origin "Trường" requires the basis document number; documents are scans in five types** | US-055, US-056; F13-05..F13-07 | CHECK constraint + DTO rule; `ChangeRequestDocument` stored with the F-10 file store; removable only before an approver has seen it (BE-01, BE-06, FE-04) |
| **Submitting computes the before/after items, checks the copy, routes the approvers and shows them first** | US-057; FR-57; EC-21..EC-24, EC-38 | Submit preview + submit; differs per workspace; level-1 rows per affected subject group, level-2 rows per affected program, level-3 one row; foreign courses go straight to level 3 (BE-05, BE-07, FE-04) |
| **Conflict warning, never a block; stale copy blocked at submit** | US-058; BR-30; EC-27 | Same-target open requests listed on the form and detail page; submit refuses a copy whose base has moved, with a "rebase" action (BE-03, BE-07) |
| **Withdraw while nobody has approved; delete only a never-submitted draft** | US-054 AC3–AC4; US-059; F13-04, F14-08 | Status rules in BE-07 and BE-03; skipped steps never count as approved |
| **List (MH-38) and read-only detail (MH-41)** | US-055 AC4; FR-58 (display half) | Visibility by scope; detail shows header, items before/after, documents, step progress per approver (BE-03, BE-05, FE-03, FE-07) |

**Key behaviours worth knowing**

| Behaviour | Why it is this way |
|---|---|
| The working copy is a real `ProgramVersion` / `Syllabus` row in status DRAFT, hidden from every list, matrix, usage count and "current version" read | Re-using the existing editors is the only way the six types get a full editor in one feature; every reader that must not see copies filters `sourceRequestId: null` (BE-02 table) |
| A request copy is excluded from the "one Draft per program / course" index | The program's own Draft (before first release) and several requests' copies can exist together; the copy is not a Draft of the program |
| Only the request's creator edits the copy, only while the request is DRAFT, and only if they still hold the edit permission on the target | US-054 AC6; the copy is the request's content — once submitted it is frozen until returned |
| Changes are stored as items at submit, and computed live while the request is a Draft | The stored items are what approvers saw (FR-67 history); the live diff spares a write on every edit |
| Submitting a request with zero changes is refused | A request must change something; `NO_CHANGES` |
| A program copy must pass the F-08 consistency check to be submitted | F-08's "submit and release block a framework with errors" constraint (`f-08-…` §8) |
| Every level's approvers are fixed at submit, all at once; each level needs **every** row at that level to approve | EC-22, EC-23 ("cần cả hai Điều phối", "cả ba Giám đốc"); fixing them up front lets the preview show exactly who and F-14 just walks the rows |
| A group with two active coordinators needs both | Literal EC-22 per person; §8 risk |
| The creator's own row is recorded as skipped with a reason, not removed | FR-61, BR-27, F14-07, F14-09 |
| A request about another faculty's course skips levels 1 and 2, recorded as "not applicable" | EC-24, KB-043 |
| An R1 creator needs another active R1 at level 3; if there is none, submit is refused with that message | F13-01 |
| Withdraw is refused once any non-skipped row in the current round has approved | FR-60, F14-08, US-059 AC3 |
| A withdrawn request keeps its copy, read-only, for the record; a deleted draft deletes its copy | US-059 AC4; US-054 AC3 |
| A document stays removable only until an approver could have seen it | US-056 AC3: removable while it was uploaded since the last submit and the request is a Draft |
| The conflict warning lists requests that are open (submitted at least once and not finished), plus the caller's own other drafts | US-058 AC1; another person's never-submitted draft is private to them |

**Not included**

| Excluded | Why |
|---|---|
| Approve, return, reject, override, comments, history per round, queue MH-42, notifications | F-14 (EP-14) |
| Final approval, decision number, effective semester, creating the released version, applying course / organisational items | F-15 (EP-15) and F-14 (organisational apply at level 3) |
| Grading-formula requests (`GRADING_FORMULA`) | F-12 is after the MVP; the enum value exists, the form shows it disabled |
| "CLO not assessed" block at submit (US-057 AC5, KB-044) | Needs F-12's assessment–CLO mapping |
| Importing Excel into a request's program copy | F-09 is after the MVP; F-09's import guard keeps refusing request copies |
| Attachments of the syllabus on a request copy | A copy shares nothing that is file-backed; attachments of a published syllabus are F-15's question |
| Delegation of approval | B6 (`ApprovalDelegation`, deferred) |
| Digital signature | F13-05: scans only |
| Audit log row for request actions | F01-07: no audit log in this release; `ApprovalStep` is the record |

---

## 1. Scope

| In scope | Why |
|---|---|
| `ChangeRequest`, `ChangeItem`, `ApprovalLevelConfig`, `ApprovalStep`, `ChangeRequestDocument`; request columns on `ProgramVersion`, `Syllabus` | DD §6; F13-08 |
| Request-Draft guard and its migration across F-07, F-08, F-10, F-11 | US-053, US-054 AC6 |
| Request CRUD, request code, conflict list, working copies, rebase | US-054, US-055, US-058 |
| Authored items: course attributes and relations, organisational changes | US-053 AC4, US-060 |
| Before/after differs for program copies and syllabus copies | FR-58 (computed here, displayed here and in F-14) |
| Documents | US-056 |
| Submit preview, submit, routing, withdraw | US-057, US-059 |
| List MH-38, form MH-39, organisational form MH-40, detail skeleton MH-41 | screen inventory |
| "Tạo đề xuất" buttons become links | US-053 AC1 |

| Out of scope | Deferred until |
|---|---|
| Approval actions, comments, queue, notifications, R1 override | F-14 |
| Final approval, release, apply | F-15 |
| `GRADING_FORMULA` editing, CLO-assessment block | F-12 (after MVP) |
| Delegation | B6 |
| Backlog filter on MH-38 ("tồn đọng") | F-14 (needs the waiting days of the queue) |

| AC | Covered by |
|---|---|
| US-053 AC1 — edit on released program opens the request form with the target chosen | FE-07 (`requestFormLink`), FE-04 (prefill) |
| US-053 AC2 — direct write on a published syllabus refused, even for R1 | F-04 `assertDirectEdit` (unchanged rule), BE-02 (`assertEditPath` keeps it for non-copies), BE-08 test |
| US-053 AC3 — program never released stays directly editable | BE-02 (no request → `assertDirectEdit` as before), BE-03 (`TARGET_NOT_RELEASED`) |
| US-053 AC4 — course in a released version: credits or relations via request | BE-04 (`COURSE_RELATION` items), FE-04 |
| US-054 AC1 — six types, saved as Draft with its own code | BE-01 (enum, sequence), BE-03, FE-04 (`GRADING_FORMULA` disabled) |
| US-054 AC2 — edits on a copy, live data unchanged | BE-01 (`sourceRequestId`), BE-03 (copy), BE-02 (read filters), BE-08 test |
| US-054 AC3 — never-submitted draft deleted by creator | BE-03 (`remove`), FE-07 |
| US-054 AC4 — returned draft cannot be deleted | BE-03 (`submissionRound > 0` → `REQUEST_NOT_DELETABLE`) |
| US-054 AC5 — R5 creating for another group's course refused | BE-03 (`assertCanCreate` → `OUT_OF_SCOPE`) |
| US-054 AC6 — editing another person's request refused | BE-02 (`NOT_CREATOR` on the copy), BE-03/BE-04/BE-06 (`assertCreatorDraft`) |
| US-055 AC1–AC2 — basis number required for "Trường" only | BE-01 (CHECK), BE-03 (DTO `@ValidateIf`), FE-04 (`dependencies` rule) |
| US-055 AC3 — UNIVERSITY origin by R3 still goes through three levels | BE-07 (routing ignores origin), BE-08 test |
| US-055 AC4 — list filter by origin | BE-03 (`origin` filter), FE-03 |
| US-056 AC1 — upload with one of five types; list shows type, name, uploader, time | BE-06, FE-04, FE-07 |
| US-056 AC2 — approvers download each document | BE-06 (`download` for any viewer), FE-07 |
| US-056 AC3 — submitted documents not removable, new ones can be added | BE-06 (`seenInRound`), FE-07 |
| US-056 AC4 — no signing | Not built (F13-05) |
| US-057 AC1 — routed to the coordinator of the course's group, not the author's other group | BE-07 (`RoutingPlanner` uses `course.ownerGroupId`), BE-08 (KB-040) |
| US-057 AC2 — courses of two groups need both coordinators; progress per person | BE-07 (one row per coordinator), FE-07 (`StepProgress`), BE-08 (KB-041 first half) |
| US-057 AC3 — course in three programs needs three directors | BE-07 (level-2 rows per affected program), BE-08 (KB-042 routing half) |
| US-057 AC4 — another faculty's course goes straight to the academic office | BE-07 (`FOREIGN_COURSE` skip rows), BE-08 (KB-043) |
| US-057 AC5 — CLO not assessed blocks submit | Deferred to F-12 |
| US-057 AC6 — resubmit restarts at level 1, round + 1 | BE-07 (`submit` increments `submissionRound`, materialises all levels), BE-08 test (Return is simulated by setting status DRAFT until F-14) |
| US-057 AC7 — affected programs shown before confirming | BE-07 (`submitPreview`), FE-04 (`SubmitConfirmModal`) |
| US-058 AC1 — warning names code, creator, status; creation still allowed | BE-03 (`ConflictFinder`), FE-04, FE-07 |
| US-058 AC2 — stale request blocked at the final step | BE-07 (`StaleChecker`, used at submit here and by F-15 at final approval) |
| US-058 AC3 — different targets, no warning | BE-03 (same target FK only) |
| US-059 AC1 — withdraw before anyone approved | BE-07 (`withdraw`), FE-07 |
| US-059 AC2 — refused once someone approved, with reason | BE-07 (`WITHDRAW_NOT_ALLOWED`) |
| US-059 AC3 — skipped level 1 does not count | BE-07 (`isSkipped` rows ignored), BE-08 test |
| US-059 AC4 — withdrawn is read-only | BE-02 (`NOT_DRAFT`), BE-03 (`findOwnDraft`), FE-07 |
| US-060 AC1 — R4 adds a member to own group; straight to level 3 | BE-04 (`ORGANIZATION` items), BE-07 (organisational routing), FE-06 |
| US-060 AC2 — applied at once on approval | F-14 (apply at level 3) — §8 constraint |
| US-060 AC3 — R2 cannot pick the six data types | BE-03 (`CHANGE_REQUEST_CREATE` not held), FE-04 / FE-06 (type list by permission) |
| US-060 AC4 — R4 for another group refused | BE-04 (`assertCan(CHANGE_REQUEST_CREATE_ORGANIZATIONAL, groupTarget)` → `OUT_OF_SCOPE`) |

### 2a. Endpoints

All under the global `/api` prefix, all requiring a session.

| Endpoint | Permission | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `GET /change-requests/:id` | `changeRequest.view` + visible | — | `ChangeRequestDetailDto` | 404 `REQUEST_NOT_FOUND` outside visibility |
| `PATCH /change-requests/:id` | creator, DRAFT | `UpdateChangeRequestDto` | `ChangeRequestDetailDto` | header fields only |
| `DELETE /change-requests/:id` | creator, DRAFT, round 0 | — | 204 | deletes the copy and the documents; 409 `REQUEST_NOT_DELETABLE` |

**`ConflictDto`**: `id`, `requestCode`, `title`, `status: ChangeRequestStatus`, `createdBy: UserRefDto`. Modeled as the `ConflictAlert` list (US-058 AC1: code, creator, status).

**`ChangeDiffDto`**

| Field | Wire type | Nullable | Source | Modeled as | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `live` | `boolean` | no | BE-05 | "Bản xem trước" note | true while DRAFT |
| `sections` | `DiffSectionDto[]` | no | BE-05 | `DiffView` tabs | one per `entityType` present, in `DIFF_SECTION_ORDER` |

**`VersionInfoEditDto`** (programs feature): `VERSION_INFO_SELECT` fields (`id, versionNumber, status, programName, majorCode, majorName, semesterCount, totalCredits, compulsoryCredits, electiveCredits, updatedAt`, decimals as strings) + `program: { id, programCode, degreeLevel }` + `sourceRequest: RequestRefDto | null` + `canEdit: boolean`.

Other features' DTOs gain one field each: `CurriculumVersionDto`, `OutcomeVersionDto`, `SyllabusDto` gain `sourceRequest: RequestRefDto | null`; `SyllabusDto.revisionNumber` becomes `number | null` (null on a request copy).

**Request DTOs**

| DTO | Fields |
|---|---|

| `UpdateChangeRequestDto` | `PartialType(PickType(CreateChangeRequestDto, ['title', 'reason', 'origin', 'basisDocumentNumber']))`; the service re-checks the origin rule on the merged row |
| `ReplaceAuthoredItemsDto` | `items: AuthoredItemInputDto[]`, ≤ `AUTHORED_ITEMS_MAX`; each a flat object discriminated by `operation`, one class per operation (BE-04) |
| `UploadChangeRequestDocumentDto` | `documentType` (`@IsEnum(ChangeDocumentType)`) + multipart `file` |
| `UpdateVersionInfoDto` (programs) | `PickType(UpdateProgramDto, version fields)` — the F-06 version fields without `degreeLevel` |

### 2c. Mismatch log

| Deliverable | What the earlier doc said | What this plan does | Found at |
|---|---|---|---|
| BE-01 | DD `ApprovalStep.approver → User` required | `approverId` nullable: level 3 is "any R1 other than the creator" (F13-01), and a "no coordinator" skip row has nobody | `data-dictionary.md` §6 `ApprovalStep`; F13-01 |
| BE-01 | DD `ApprovalStep` has no group or program column | ⊕ `forSubjectGroupId`, `forProgramId`, so EC-22 / EC-23 progress can name whose approval a row stands for | EC-22 "hiển thị tiến độ phê duyệt theo từng người" |
| BE-01 | DD `ChangeRequest.targetCode` only | ⊕ `courseId`, `programId`, `subjectGroupId` (exactly one set, CHECK) beside `targetCode`; conflict and visibility join on the key | `data-dictionary.md` §6; codes can be renamed, ids cannot |
| BE-01 | DD `ChangeItem` has `entityType`, `recordId`, `oldValue`, `newValue`, `baseVersion` | ⊕ `itemKey` (natural key: course code, PLO code, field name) and `sortOrder`; the diff matches on natural keys because the copy has new row ids | F13-08; BE-05 |
| BE-01 | DD `ChangeRequestDocument.recordedAt` | `createdAt` like every other table, plus `sizeBytes`, `fileType`, `seenInRound` | F-10 `SyllabusAttachment` (`f-10-…:304-317`); US-056 AC3 |
| BE-01 | DD `ChangeRequest` ⊕ `decisionNumber?`, `signedDate?`, `effectiveSemester?` | Not added here; F-15 adds them with `Semester` | F-15 owns MH-43 |
| BE-01 | DD `ApprovalStep.delegation` | Not added (B6) | `deferred-scope.md` |
| BE-01 | F-10: `Syllabus.revisionNumber Int`, `@@unique([courseId, revisionNumber])` | `revisionNumber Int?`, null on a request copy (CHECK: null only with `sourceRequestId`); F-15 numbers the copy when it publishes | `f-10-…:268-290` |
| BE-02 | F-07/F-10/F-11: "F-13 opens the released path" | Opened by a request copy, not by relaxing `assertDirectEdit`; the released program's own data still answers `CHANGE_REQUEST_REQUIRED` | `f-07-…` §8, `f-10-…` §8, `f-11-…` §8 constraints |
| BE-03 | DD: ORGANIZATION requests change "thành viên nhóm, Điều phối hoặc phân công Giám đốc CTĐT" | Four operations: add member (any role), end membership, assign director, end director — the F-03 and F-06 write shapes | US-060; `f-03-…:1066-1082`, `f-06-…:178` |
| BE-04 | FR-56 "sửa quan hệ học phần" | `COURSE_RELATION` also carries course attribute changes (credits, name, type, owner group); there is no "course info" type and US-053 AC4 sends credits through a request | US-053 AC4; FR-56 |
| BE-07 | US-057 AC5 / KB-044 block on unassessed CLO | Not checked (F-12 after MVP); NT-B4-02's grading-formula walk becomes a syllabus-content walk | `test-plan.md:206`, `:326`; DOC-01 |
| BE-03 | F-10 §8: the request copy copies attachment rows and sets `previousVersionId` | Attachments are not copied and a copy refuses uploads (`REQUEST_COPY_NO_ATTACHMENTS`); the copy points at its base through `baseRevisionId`, and `previousVersionId` stays F-15's to set when it publishes | `f-10-…:1890`; US-077 is F-15's |
| BE-04 | F-03 D14: `UserSelect` searches `GET /users`, "allowed for R1, who is the only writer" | R2 and R4 now pick members and directors too; `GET /change-requests/user-options` serves them, and `UserSelect` gains a `searchPath` prop | `f-03-…:236` |
| — | MH-38 "R1 có thêm bộ lọc tồn đọng" | Left to F-14 with the queue's waiting days | `screen-inventory.md:114` |

## 3. Decisions

| # | Decision | Why | Rejected alternative |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | A workspace request owns a **working copy** — a `ProgramVersion` or `Syllabus` row in status DRAFT with `sourceRequestId` set — edited through the existing screens | F13-08. Each type already has a full editor with validation; a second editor per type would double F-06..F-11's UI and drift from their rules | Items edited as JSON in a generic form (no validation reuse); a per-field patch log replayed at apply (every rule re-implemented on JSON) |
| D2 | The copy's permission check is "creator ∧ request DRAFT ∧ still holds the edit permission on the target", in one shared `assertEditPath` | US-054 AC6; a lecturer removed from the group mid-draft must lose the copy too. One function so the four feature guards cannot drift | A separate guard per feature; checking only the creator |
| D3 | Type → workspace: `CURRICULUM`, `PROGRAM_INFO`, `OUTCOME` on a program → program copy; `SYLLABUS_CONTENT`, `OUTCOME` on a course → syllabus copy; `COURSE_RELATION`, `ORGANIZATION` → authored items | The type is the label and the permission check; the copy carries whatever the creator changed. A curriculum request that also edits a PLO is still one request — F-15 numbers by what the items contain | One copy per type with the other screens read-only — splits one real change into several requests |
| D4 | Items are generated at submit and stored; while DRAFT the diff is computed live | Stored items are what approvers saw and survive later edits of the base; live diff avoids a write per edit | Writing items on every copy edit (every feature write path would need a hook) |
| D5 | Differs match rows by natural key (course code, group code, PLO code, CLO code, field name) | The copy has new row ids; codes are unique within a version / revision and are what a reader recognises | Matching by `recordId` — copies break it |
| D6 | All approval rows of all three levels are created at submit; the status points at the lowest level with a PENDING row | The preview shows the exact same rows; F-14 only walks them; resubmit makes a fresh set with round + 1 (BR-29) | Creating level N+1 rows when level N completes — the preview could disagree with what happens |
| D7 | Every row at a level must approve | EC-22, EC-23 are per person ("cần cả hai Điều phối", "cả ba Giám đốc") | One approval per group or per program — §8 risk lists the alternative |
| D8 | `ApprovalStep.approverId` is null at level 3: any active R1 other than the creator acts | F13-01; Phòng Đào tạo is an office, not a person | One row per R1 — every R1 would have to approve |
| D9 | Visibility: unscoped `changeRequest.view` sees all; otherwise creator ∨ has a step ∨ target inside the caller's scope; a never-submitted draft is visible only to its creator | MH-38 "đề xuất của tôi và các đề xuất trong phạm vi của mình"; a draft is private work | Showing drafts to scope holders |
| D10 | Conflict = same target key, other request, status open (DRAFT with round > 0, PENDING_*, APPROVED) or the caller's own other drafts | BR-30; another person's private draft must not leak through the warning | Including every draft — leaks titles of private drafts |
| D11 | Stale = the base moved: program copy's base version is no longer the newest non-Draft version; syllabus copy's base is no longer the published revision; an authored course item's `oldValue` differs from now | EC-27 optimistic lock; US-058 AC2. One `StaleChecker` in `src/shared/change-requests/` used at submit here and at final approval by F-15 | Version counters on every table |
| D12 | Rebase re-copies from the newest base and discards the copy's edits, after a confirm | Merging edits onto a new base is a three-way merge per table; US-058 AC2 says "phải soạn lại trên bản mới" | Automatic merge |
| D13 | Request code `DX-<year>-<NNNN>` from one PostgreSQL sequence, never reset | Unique and gap-tolerant under concurrency; the year is the creation year for reading only | `MAX + 1` per year (race), a counter table (lock) |
| D14 | Shared code in `src/shared/change-requests/`: `request-draft.ts` (guard), `StaleChecker`, snapshot readers and differs | F-07/F-08/F-10/F-11 need the guard; F-14 shows diffs; F-15 needs the stale check and snapshots. Features do not import each other | Inside the feature — F-15 would have to import it |
| D15 | `PROGRAM_INFO` copies cannot change `degreeLevel` | It lives on `Program`, not on the version; a version-scoped request cannot carry it | Adding `degreeLevel` to the version — schema change for a field that never changes in practice |
| D16 | `ORGANIZATION` requests skip levels 1 and 2 by routing, not by skip rows | US-060 AC1 "không qua cấp 1 và cấp 2"; they never had those levels, so no "skipped" history is written | Writing skip rows — reads as if someone was bypassed |
| D17 | `GRADING_FORMULA` is in the enum but refused by `CREATABLE_TYPES` | F-12 is after the MVP; the value keeps the DD's type list and the form shows it disabled with "Chưa hỗ trợ" | Leaving the value out — a migration later for an enum add |
| D18 | A request copy is readable by id by anyone who may read its target (curriculum, outcome, syllabus screens); the "private draft" rule of D9 applies to the request list, detail and conflict list only | The copy's id is reached only through the request; adding a privacy check to every reader of F-07..F-11 multiplies the call sites for a draft whose content the same people will review once submitted | A visibility check in every reader — §8 risk keeps it as the fallback if a reviewer objects |

Commands, in `source/backend` with Docker running: `pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --create-only --name change_requests`, edit the SQL, `pnpm exec prisma migrate dev`, `pnpm exec prisma generate`, `pnpm exec prisma db seed`.

**Rationale**: Table shapes follow DD §6 with the §2c deviations. The CHECK-plus-partial-index style mirrors F-06's `ProgramVersion_one_draft` (`f-06-…:312`) and F-11's `CoursePLOMapping` CHECK. The document table mirrors F-10's `SyllabusAttachment` (`f-10-…:304`). The seed mirrors F-02's `seedAccessControl` upsert-by-natural-key.

**Gotchas**
- Rule 13: re-read `ROLE_CODES` key names at build (`f-02-…:449`); the seed above assumes `ACADEMIC_OFFICE`, `PROGRAM_DIRECTOR`, `SUBJECT_GROUP_COORDINATOR` keys for R1, R3, R4. Use whatever F-02 named them, never the string `'R1'`.
- Prisma does not model partial indexes: after `DROP INDEX` / `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`, `prisma migrate dev` must show no drift. F-06 and F-10 already live with this; keep their names.
- `ChangeRequestDocument` is `Restrict`, not `Cascade`: deleting a request must delete the files too, so the service removes rows and files explicitly (BE-03). A cascade would leave orphan files with no row pointing at them.
- `ProgramVersion.sourceRequest` and `Syllabus.sourceRequest` are `Restrict`: the copy is deleted before the request (BE-03 `remove`).
- `revisionNumber` turning nullable makes every F-10/F-11 reader of it `number | null` at compile time. The type checker lists them; each is a non-copy read (copies are filtered, BE-02) and takes a `!` only where the row is provably not a copy — prefer narrowing by `sourceRequestId === null`.
- `ChangeItem.@@unique([changeRequestId, entityType, itemKey])` is what lets the differ and the authored-item editor replace items without duplicates.

**Verify**: migration applies on an empty database and on one seeded with F-01..F-11 data; `prisma migrate dev` reports no drift; `psql` `\d "ChangeRequest"` lists both CHECKs; inserting `origin = 'UNIVERSITY'` with a null basis number fails; seed is idempotent (run twice). `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

What/Why: US-053, US-054 AC2, AC6; D1, D2, D15, D18. The copy is edited through the existing screens; their write guards learn one more path and their reads stop seeing copies.

| `assertCurriculumWrite` (definition) | `f-07-…:746` | migrated (above); `VERSION_ACCESS_SELECT` gains `REQUEST_DRAFT_SELECT` |
| curriculum items `create` / `update` / `remove` / `reorder` | `f-07-…:889`, `:915`, `:934`, `:941` | unchanged — they call `assertCurriculumWrite` |

| elective groups `create` / `update` / `remove` / `assign` | `f-07-…:1326`, `:1337`, `:1351`, `:1358` | unchanged — calls `assertCurriculumWrite` |

| `programEditState` | `f-06-…:375` | left: same reason |
| `programInclude(today).versions` | F-06 BE-02 | migrated: `where: { sourceRequestId: null }` — program list, detail, `currentVersion`, and `clone`'s source lookup never see a copy |
| `ProgramsService.update` | `f-06-…:715` | migrated: finds the Draft among `programInclude` versions (already copy-free); the field write moves to `ProgramVersionInfoService.write` |
| `ProgramsService.clone` with `sourceVersionId` | `f-06-…:857` | left: the source list comes from `programInclude`, so a copy id is "not found"; a spec case pins it |

| F-04 course `update`, `setStatus` | `f-04-…:701`, `:726`, `:733` | left: courses have no copy; changes go through `COURSE_RELATION` items (BE-04) |
| F-05 relation writes | `f-05-…:543`, `:619` | left: same |
| F-09 `assertCurriculumImport` | `f-09-…` | left: refuses any version with `sourceRequestId` (F-09 is after the MVP; §8 constraint) |

`version-info.dto.ts`: `UpdateVersionInfoDto = PickType(UpdateProgramDto, ['programName', 'majorCode', 'majorName', 'semesterCount', 'totalCredits', 'compulsoryCredits', 'electiveCredits'])` — the `versionData` fields; `VersionInfoEditDto` per §2b; `VERSION_INFO_ROW_SELECT = { ...VERSION_INFO_SELECT, programId: true, program: { select: { id: true, facultyId: true, programCode: true, degreeLevel: true } }, ...REQUEST_DRAFT_SELECT }`. `ProgramsService.update` keeps its `degreeLevel` write and calls `versionInfo.write(tx, draft, versionFields)` inside its existing transaction (converted to the interactive form).

**Rationale**: One guard in `src/shared/` because four features need it and features do not import each other (D14). The lazy `state` thunk keeps a copy write from querying the program's release state it does not need. The version-info service mirrors F-08's `program-versions/:versionId` controller layout (`f-08-…` BE-04). The call-site table mirrors F-11's migration table for `itemTarget` (`f-11-…:455-462`).

**Gotchas**
- Rule 13: `programInclude` and `SYLLABUS_ACCESS_SELECT` names and files are re-read at build; the plan names their F-06 / F-10 homes but not their final file.
- Deleting a syllabus copy through the F-10 "delete draft" route must be refused, or the request would point at nothing. In `remove`, after `assertDraftWrite`, add `if (row.sourceRequest) throw new AppException(REQUEST_DRAFT_ERRORS.COPY_DELETED_WITH_REQUEST)`.
- `ProgramsService.update` must not start writing copies: its Draft lookup is over the copy-free `programInclude` list, so a released program still answers `CHANGE_REQUEST_REQUIRED` there. The copy's info form uses the new route only.
- The `updateMany` in `write` is conditional on DRAFT so a submit racing an edit loses cleanly (count 0 is ignored on purpose: the next read shows the frozen state).
- `assertEditPath` checks permission before creator, so a creator who lost the edit permission gets `PERMISSION_DENIED`, and a colleague with the permission gets `REQUEST_NOT_CREATOR` — the message that explains what happened.

**Verify**: `request-draft.spec.ts` — no request → `assertDirectEdit` called with the awaited state; copy + creator + DRAFT + permission → passes; other user → `REQUEST_NOT_CREATOR`; creator without permission → `PERMISSION_DENIED`; status `PENDING_COORDINATOR` → `REQUEST_NOT_DRAFT`; state thunk never called for a copy. Existing F-07 / F-10 / F-11 / F-08 specs still pass with `sourceRequest: null` added to their fixtures. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

**Depends on**: BE-01

`ChangeRequestDetailReader` (`change-request-detail.reader.ts`) loads one request with `visibleWhere`, its documents, current-round steps, authored items, the copy (`programCopy` / `syllabusCopy` with base label), conflicts and the caller's `RequestActionsDto`; 404 `REQUEST_NOT_FOUND` when not visible. It is split from the service to keep both under the ~250-line guideline (nestjs-rules §2).

BE-04..BE-07 add their routes to this controller (items, diff, submit-preview, submit, withdraw, documents) and a second `ChangeRequestDocumentsController` for `change-request-documents/:documentId`.

`change-requests.module.ts`: `imports: [ProgramsSharedModule, CurriculumSharedModule, CoursesSharedModule, FilesModule, MulterModule.registerAsync(…)]` (the F-10 limits factory), `controllers`, `providers` for every service, resolver, finder and reader of BE-03..BE-07. `app.module.ts` imports `ChangeRequestsModule`.

**Rationale**: The service shape mirrors F-06's `ProgramsService` (`findOrThrow` + conditional `updateMany` + `toDetail`), the list mirrors F-04's paged course list. The resolver mirrors F-04's `courseTarget` / F-06's `programTarget` helpers, gathered so every request entry point resolves a target the same way. The sequence mirrors PostgreSQL practice for human-readable codes (D13).

**Gotchas**
- `access.assertCan(CHANGE_REQUEST_CREATE, {})` with an empty target: the CREATE cell is `X` (unscoped) for R1, R3, R4, R5, so `{}` is enough; the scoped check is on the edit permission. Rule 13: re-read `assertCan`'s handling of `{}` (`f-02-…:700-720`).
- `assertCanCreate` reports through `assertCan(codes[0], …)` so the caller gets `OUT_OF_SCOPE` when they hold the edit permission elsewhere (US-054 AC5) and `PERMISSION_DENIED` when they hold none.
- R2 holds `CHANGE_REQUEST_VIEW` but not `CHANGE_REQUEST_CREATE`: picking a data type answers `PERMISSION_DENIED` (US-060 AC3).
- `nextRequestCode` runs inside the transaction; if the transaction rolls back, the number is lost. Gaps are allowed (D13).
- `remove` uses an empty `updateMany` as a guard read inside the transaction so a submit racing the delete is caught; a plain `findFirst` would not lock anything either, but the conditional update fails on a changed row without a second round trip.
- `createManyAndReturn` is supported on PostgreSQL in Prisma 7; Rule 13: re-read the generated client's method name for model `CLO` (`tx.cLO`) at build.
- Files are removed after the transaction commits, never inside it: a rollback after a file removal would leave rows pointing at nothing (F-10's attachment removal does the same, `f-10-…:1104`).
- `findOwnDraft` filters by `visibleWhere` first, so another user's private draft answers 404, not 403.

**Verify**: `change-requests.service.spec.ts` (mocked Prisma): create refuses `GRADING_FORMULA` at the DTO (`CREATABLE_TYPES`); type/target mismatch → `TYPE_TARGET_MISMATCH`; R5 on another group's course → `OUT_OF_SCOPE`; R2 with `CURRICULUM` → `PERMISSION_DENIED`; `UNIVERSITY` without basis → 400 (DTO) and `BASIS_REQUIRED` (update merge); delete with round 1 → `REQUEST_NOT_DELETABLE`; delete removes copy, document rows, then files after commit; rebase on `COURSE_RELATION` → `NOT_WORKSPACE_TYPE`. `working-copy.service.spec.ts`: program with only a Draft → `TARGET_NOT_RELEASED`; base = newest non-Draft non-copy; copier called with base and copy ids. `syllabus-revision.copier.spec.ts`: CLO codes and week–CLO links re-pointed to the copy's ids; attachments not copied; `revisionNumber` null. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

Controller additions: `@Put(':id/items') replaceItems(...)` → `AuthoredItemsService.replace`; and the picker source for MH-40, declared **before** `@Get(':id')` so the literal path wins:

```ts
@Get('user-options')
@RequirePermission(PERMISSIONS.CHANGE_REQUEST_CREATE_ORGANIZATIONAL)
@ApiOkResponse({ type: [UserOptionDto] })
userOptions(@Query() query: UserOptionQueryDto): Promise<UserOptionDto[]> {
  return this.authoredItems.userOptions(query.q);
}
```

```ts
// AuthoredItemsService — R2 and R4 cannot call GET /users, which is R1-only.
userOptions(q: string | undefined): Promise<UserOptionDto[]> {
  const term = q?.trim();
  return this.prisma.user.findMany({
    where: {
      status: UserStatus.ACTIVE,
      ...(term && { OR: [{ userCode: { contains: term, mode: 'insensitive' } }, { fullName: { contains: term, mode: 'insensitive' } }, { username: { contains: term, mode: 'insensitive' } }] }),
    },
    select: { id: true, userCode: true, fullName: true },
    orderBy: { userCode: 'asc' },
    take: CHANGE_REQUEST_LIMITS.USER_OPTIONS_MAX,
  });
}
```

`UserOptionDto { id, userCode, fullName }` and `UserOptionQueryDto { q?: string (≤ 100) }` in `authored-item.dto.ts`; `USER_OPTIONS_MAX: 20` joins `CHANGE_REQUEST_LIMITS`.

**Rationale**: The operation shapes mirror the F-03 member DTOs (`f-03-…:1066-1082`), F-06 director DTOs (`f-06-…:178`), F-05 relation DTOs (`f-05-…:464-485`) and F-04's `UpdateCourseDto` fields, so F-14 / F-15 can hand the payload to the owning feature's writer unchanged. The discriminator mirrors class-transformer's documented `subTypes` pattern; no earlier plan uses it — this is its first use.

**Gotchas**
- Only light checks run here (existence, ownership by the target, unchanged value). The owning feature's full rules — F-03 `COORDINATOR_NOT_MEMBER` and overlap, F-05 cycle detection, F-04 credit consistency — run when F-14 / F-15 apply the item. A request can therefore be approved and still fail at apply; §8 records the constraint on F-14 and F-15.
- `ownerGroupId` changes move a course to another group's scope: the request's own routing uses the **current** owner group (BE-07), so the old group's coordinator approves the move.
- `REMOVE_RELATION` keeps a non-null `newValue` because the item must carry the relation id for the apply; the differ in BE-05 reads `operation` to show "Xóa".
- Dates are ISO days compared as strings only after `parsePeriod` (F-03 `validity.ts`); never `new Date(string)` in a comparison — time zones shift the day.
- `assertCan(CHANGE_REQUEST_CREATE_ORGANIZATIONAL, target.scope)` already ran at create; an R4 whose coordinator period ended mid-draft keeps their draft but `replace` re-checks it: `membership` / `director` call `access.assertCan(...)` on the target first (US-060 AC4 stays true over time).

**Verify**: `authored-items.service.spec.ts`: `CURRICULUM` request → `ITEMS_NOT_AUTHORED`; `ADD_MEMBER` on a `COURSE_RELATION` request → `OPERATION_NOT_FOR_TYPE`; `SET_COURSE_FIELD credits` equal to current → `ITEM_UNCHANGED`; relation not touching the course → `OPERATION_TARGET_MISMATCH`; `END_MEMBERSHIP` of another group's row → `OPERATION_TARGET_MISMATCH`; two identical `ADD_RELATION` → `ITEM_DUPLICATE`; replace deletes then inserts in one transaction; submitted request → `REQUEST_NOT_DRAFT`. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

`itemEntries(item)` yields one `CURRICULUM_ITEM` entry keyed by course code (`plannedSemester`, `sortOrder`, `blockSymbol`, `isElective`, `electiveGroup` code, `htDa`, `tqDa`, `minStudiedScore`, `minTransferScore`, `note`), one `CURRICULUM_REQUISITE` per requisite keyed `"<course>|<source>|<type>"` (`minScore`), one `COURSE_PLO` per mapping keyed `"<course>|<plo>"` (`weight`), and one `CLO_PLO` per link keyed `"<course>|<clo>|<plo>"` (`linked: 'true'`). `scalar` turns `Decimal`, `number`, `boolean` and `Date` into strings with `toWireDecimal` for decimals, so `"3.00"` and `"3"` never differ.

  }
  return sortDrafts(drafts).map((draft, sortOrder) => ({ ...draft, sortOrder }));
}
```

`sortDrafts` orders by `DIFF_SECTION_ORDER` (the `SNAPSHOT_ENTITY` order above, then the four authored entities) and by `itemKey` with `localeCompare(…, 'vi')`. `recordId` of a removed or changed entry is the **base** row id (the copy's id would be meaningless once the copy is gone); of an added one, null. `baseVersion` is the base version / revision id.

```ts
// src/shared/change-requests/diff/diff-presenter.ts
export function toDiffSections(items: readonly StoredItemLike[]): DiffSectionDto[] {
  const groups = Map.groupBy(items, (item) => item.entityType);
  return DIFF_SECTION_ORDER.filter((type) => groups.has(type)).map((type) => ({
    entityType: type,
    title: DIFF_SECTION_TITLES[type],
    rows: groups.get(type)!.map(toDiffRow),
  }));
}
```

`toDiffRow` sets `change` to `ADDED` / `REMOVED` / `CHANGED` from the null-ness of `oldValue` / `newValue`, except for authored items where the operation decides (`ADD_*`, `ASSIGN_*` → ADDED; `REMOVE_*`, `END_*` → REMOVED; others → CHANGED). `fields` lists only the keys whose before and after differ, labelled from `DIFF_FIELD_LABELS`; an added or removed row lists every non-null key.

```ts
// src/features/change-requests/request-items.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class RequestItemsService {
  constructor(private readonly prisma: PrismaService) {}

  // Workspace drafts are diffed live (D4); everything else reads the stored items.
  async current(db: PrismaService | Prisma.TransactionClient, request: ItemSource): Promise<{ live: boolean; items: ChangeItemDraft[] }> {

      return { live: false, items: await db.changeItem.findMany({ where: { changeRequestId: request.id }, orderBy: { sortOrder: 'asc' } }) as ChangeItemDraft[] };
    }
    return { live: true, items: await this.liveItems(db, request, kind) };
  }

  async liveItems(db: PrismaService | Prisma.TransactionClient, request: ItemSource, kind: WorkspaceKind): Promise<ChangeItemDraft[]> {
    if (kind === WORKSPACE_KIND.PROGRAM_VERSION) {
      const copy = await db.programVersion.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { sourceRequestId: request.id }, select: { id: true, baseVersionId: true } });
      return diffSnapshots(await readProgramSnapshot(db, copy.baseVersionId!), await readProgramSnapshot(db, copy.id), copy.baseVersionId!);
    }
    const copy = await db.syllabus.findUniqueOrThrow({ where: { sourceRequestId: request.id }, select: { id: true, baseRevisionId: true } });

    const { live, items } = await this.current(this.prisma, request);
    return { live, sections: toDiffSections(items) };
  }
}
```

Controller addition: `@Get(':id/diff')` → `RequestItemsService.diff`.

**Rationale**: One differ over flat entries instead of one per table: every table reduces to "natural key → field map", and F-14 (display) and F-15 (apply by entity) consume the same entries. The readers mirror the F-07 / F-11 copier steps table by table (`f-07-…:484-520`, `f-11-…:496-530`) — what the copier copies is exactly what the differ must compare. `findVisibleRequest` is the detail reader's lookup, exported from `change-request-detail.reader.ts`.

**Gotchas**
- The diff compares the copy with its **base**, not with the newest release: after someone else's change lands, the diff still shows only this request's edits; staleness is reported separately (BE-07).
- A `CLO_PLO` link exists in the program copy, but its CLO belongs to the course's published syllabus: if a syllabus request renames a CLO code, the program copy's link keys change too only after F-15 re-points them. Program diffs never see syllabus edits.
- `Map.groupBy` needs Node 21+; the project is on Node 22 (CLAUDE.md). Rule 13: confirm `lib` in `tsconfig.json` includes `ES2024` — if not, use a local reduce.
- `readProgramSnapshot` on a large program reads every item with its mappings; keep it to one query with `include` as above, never a query per item.
- Text sections compare whole strings; whitespace-only edits count as changes. That is intended: approvers see what was saved.

**Verify**: `snapshot-differ.spec.ts`: identical snapshots → `[]`; course added / removed / semester changed → one `CURRICULUM_ITEM` each with the right null side; decimal `3.00` vs `3` → no item; requisite added → keyed `"IT3020|IT3011|PREREQUISITE"`; PLO description changed → `CHANGED` with only `description` in the presenter's `fields`; removed entry carries the base `recordId`; order follows `DIFF_SECTION_ORDER`. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

Controllers: `@Post(':id/documents')` on `ChangeRequestsController` with `@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('file'))`, `@ApiConsumes('multipart/form-data')`; `ChangeRequestDocumentsController` (`@Controller('change-request-documents')`, class-level `@RequirePermission(CHANGE_REQUEST_VIEW)`) with `@Get(':documentId/file')` → `sendFile(res, …)` and `@Delete(':documentId')` 204.

**Rationale**: Mirrors F-10's `SyllabusAttachmentsService` line for line (`f-10-…:1040-1124`): same storage service, same type detection, same write-then-row-then-remove-on-failure order, same `sendFile`. Only the lock rule differs.

**Gotchas**
- The lock is the conditional `deleteMany` (`seenInRound: null` and request DRAFT): a submit that sets `seenInRound` between the read and the delete wins, and the user gets `DOCUMENT_LOCKED`.
- `seenInRound` for a document uploaded while DRAFT is filled by submit (BE-07); a returned Draft (round ≥ 1) keeps earlier documents locked and new ones removable until the next submit — exactly US-056 AC3.
- `FILE_ERRORS` is F-10's (`ATTACHMENT_FILE_REQUIRED`, `ATTACHMENT_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `ATTACHMENT_TOO_LARGE` via Multer limits); Rule 13: re-read its home in `src/shared/files/` at build.
- Never pass `file.originalname` to the path; `uploadedFileName` sanitises the display name only.

**Verify**: `change-request-documents.service.spec.ts`: no file → `ATTACHMENT_FILE_REQUIRED`; non-creator → `REQUEST_NOT_CREATOR`; WITHDRAWN → `REQUEST_CLOSED`; 21st → `DOCUMENTS_LIMIT`; DB create fails → `files.remove` called; upload while PENDING sets `seenInRound` = round; remove with `seenInRound` 1 → `DOCUMENT_LOCKED`; remove deletes the file after the row. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

`StaleChecker` is provided by a new `ChangeRequestsSharedModule` (`src/shared/change-requests/change-requests-shared.module.ts`, exports `StaleChecker`) so F-15 can inject it.

  approverId: string | null;
  forSubjectGroupId: string | null;

@Injectable()

    const academicOffice = await this.academicOfficeStep(db, request.createdById, today);
    if (request.requestType === ChangeRequestType.ORGANIZATION) return { steps: [academicOffice], affectedPrograms: [] };

    if (request.course && request.course.ownerFacultyCode !== HOME_FACULTY_CODE) {
      return {
        steps: [skip(APPROVAL_LEVEL.COORDINATOR, SKIP_REASONS.FOREIGN_COURSE), skip(APPROVAL_LEVEL.DIRECTOR, SKIP_REASONS.FOREIGN_COURSE), academicOffice],

    return { steps, affectedPrograms: programs };
  }
  // helpers below
}
```

Rules the helpers implement:

| Helper | Rule | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `affectedHomeCourses` | Course target → that course. Program copy → the distinct course codes in `CURRICULUM_ITEM`, `CURRICULUM_REQUISITE`, `COURSE_PLO`, `CLO_PLO` items, resolved to courses; foreign courses dropped (they have no coordinator here) | FR-57; EC-24 |
| `coordinatorSteps` | Group the courses by `ownerGroupId`. Each group: one row per active coordinator (`memberRole: COORDINATOR`, `activeMembershipWhere(today)`) with `forSubjectGroupId`; none → one skipped row `NO_COORDINATOR`. Courses with no group → one skipped row `NO_GROUP`. No course at all → one skipped row `NO_COURSE` | EC-21, EC-22; US-057 AC1–AC2 |
| `programsUsing` | Programs with an `ACTIVE` or `PENDING` version (not a copy) containing the course, program `ACTIVE`; ordered by program code | US-057 AC3, AC7; EC-23 |
| `directorSteps` | Each program: one row per active director (`activeDirectorWhere(today)`) with `forProgramId`; none → skipped row `NO_DIRECTOR`. Course target with no program → skipped row `NO_PROGRAM` | EC-23 |
| `academicOfficeStep` | One row, `approverId` null. If the creator holds an active R1 assignment and no **other** active user does → `SUBMISSION_ERRORS.NO_OTHER_ACADEMIC_OFFICE` | F13-01; D8 |
| creator skip | A row whose approver is the creator → skipped, `CREATOR` | FR-61, BR-27 |
| `skip(level, reason)` | `{ approverId: null, isSkipped: true, skipReason: reason, … }` | KB-043 |

Active R1 holders: `RoleAssignment` with `role.roleCode = ROLE_CODES.ACADEMIC_OFFICE`, `revokedAt: null`, `coversDay(today)`, `user.status = ACTIVE` (F-02 `RoleAssignment`, `f-02-…:491`).

Controller additions: `@Get(':id/submit-preview')`, `@Post(':id/submit')` (200), `@Post(':id/withdraw')` (200).

**Rationale**: The transaction order mirrors F-08's submit constraint ("`lockRequisiteGraph(tx)` then `assertPasses(versionId, tx)`", `f-08-…` §8) and F-07's conditional-`updateMany` claim. The planner is a pure function of the database and the items so the preview and the submit cannot disagree (D6). The planner's active-row filters reuse F-03 and F-06's shared helpers, whose comments already name "level-1 / level-2 approver lookups" as their purpose (`f-03-…:428`, `f-06-…:347`).

**Gotchas**
- The round is claimed first so two submits cannot both pass; everything after runs under that claim, and any throw rolls the claim back.
- `firstPendingStatus` always finds level 3 — its row is never skipped (the creator is never its approver, the row has none). If every level-1 and level-2 row is skipped, the request starts at `PENDING_ACADEMIC_OFFICE`.
- A Return in F-14 sets the request to DRAFT with the round unchanged; resubmitting increments it and creates a full new set of rows (US-057 AC6). Older rounds' rows stay for the history.
- Withdraw leaves PENDING rows untouched: F-14's queue filters by request status, so they leave every queue at once (US-059 AC1).
- Skipped rows are `APPROVE` + `isSkipped`; every count of approvals (withdraw here, completion in F-14) filters `isSkipped: false`.
- The preview swallows only `AppException`s; anything else is a bug and propagates.
- A course-target `OUTCOME` or `SYLLABUS_CONTENT` request needs the director of **every** program using the course (EC-23); a program-target request needs only that program's director.

**Verify**: `routing-planner.spec.ts` (mocked Prisma): KB-040 — course of group A, author also member of B → one level-1 row for A's coordinator; KB-041 — two groups → two rows; a group with two coordinators → two rows; KB-042 — course in three programs → three level-2 rows; KB-043 — foreign course → two skipped rows "Không áp dụng" and level 3; R3 creator on own program → their level-2 row skipped `CREATOR`; R1 creator alone → `NO_OTHER_ACADEMIC_OFFICE`; `ORGANIZATION` → level 3 only. `submission.service.spec.ts`: zero items → `NO_CHANGES`; stale → `STALE_BASE`; consistency error → `CONSISTENCY_FAILED`; success writes items, sets `seenInRound`, creates rows with round 1 and status `PENDING_COORDINATOR`; all level-1/2 skipped → `PENDING_ACADEMIC_OFFICE`; withdraw with one non-skipped APPROVE → `WITHDRAW_NOT_ALLOWED`; with only skipped APPROVEs → WITHDRAWN. `stale-checker.spec.ts`: base equals newest → fresh; newer PENDING version → stale; course field changed since → stale. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

| R5 opens a `SYLLABUS_CONTENT` request on own group's course with a published syllabus | 201, code `DX-<year>-0001`, `workspace.kind = SYLLABUS`; `GET /courses/:id/syllabus` still shows the published text; `?requestId=` shows the copy |
| Same R5 edits the copy through `PATCH /syllabi/:copyId` | 200; the published revision is unchanged (US-054 AC2) |
| Another R5 of the same group edits that copy | 403 `REQUEST_NOT_CREATOR` (US-054 AC6) |
| R1 writes the published syllabus directly | 409 `CHANGE_REQUEST_REQUIRED` (US-053 AC2) |
| R5 creates a request for another group's course | 403 `OUT_OF_SCOPE` (US-054 AC5) |
| R3 opens `CURRICULUM` on a never-released program | 409 `TARGET_NOT_RELEASED` (US-053 AC3) |
| R3 opens `CURRICULUM` on a released program, moves a course of group A and one of group B, submits | rows: A's coordinator, both B coordinators, R3's own level-2 row skipped `CREATOR`, level 3; status `PENDING_COORDINATOR` (KB-041) |
| Submit with no edits | 409 `NO_CHANGES` |
| Submit after another release of the program | 409 `STALE_BASE`; `POST /rebase` → 200 and the copy's base is the new version (US-058 AC2) |
| Foreign course `COURSE_RELATION` request with one `SET_COURSE_FIELD credits` | levels 1, 2 skipped "Không áp dụng — học phần của khoa khác"; status `PENDING_ACADEMIC_OFFICE` (KB-043, US-057 AC4) |
| Course used by three programs, `SYLLABUS_CONTENT` submit | three level-2 rows (KB-042, US-057 AC3); submit preview lists the three programs (US-057 AC7) |
| R3 `UNIVERSITY` origin without basis number | 400; with it → submitted through all three levels (US-055 AC1, AC3) |
| Second request on the same target | `conflicts` names the first's code, creator, status; creation succeeds (US-058 AC1); a request on another course shows none (AC3) |

**Rationale**: Mirrors F-11's e2e layout (`test/outcomes.e2e-spec.ts`) with `createTestApp` and per-role login helpers from F-02. `releaseVersionForTest` and `publishSyllabusForTest` are the stand-ins F-07 and F-10 left for F-15.

**Gotchas**
- The request code sequence is not reset between tests; assert the pattern `^DX-\d{4}-\d{4}$`, not a number, except in a fresh container.
- `returnForTest` exists only until F-14; F-14's plan lists its calls for replacement.
- Testcontainers runs the real migration, so the partial indexes and CHECKs are under test here and nowhere else.

**Verify**: `pnpm test:e2e -- change-requests`.

### FE-01 — Types, permissions, routes, menu, labels

What/Why: The generated types, five routes, the "Đề xuất thay đổi" menu entry, and every Vietnamese label the request screens share.

**Rationale**: As F-11 FE-01 (`f-11-…:1401`): routes in `src/routes.ts`, lazy pages in `router.tsx`, permission strings mirrored from the backend, the menu entry carries its permission (F-02 `APP_MENU`, `f-02-…:2345`). `ChangeRequestEditPage` is guarded by `changeRequestView` only, because the organisational creator (R2) does not hold `changeRequestCreate`; the page itself redirects when `permissions.canEdit` is false.

**Gotchas**
- Rule 13: confirm the permission code strings against F-02's `PERMISSIONS` file and the icon import against the menu file's existing imports.
- `programVersionInfo` lives in the programs feature (FE-05), but the route constant joins the others here so FE-05 and FE-07 can link to it.
- `REQUEST_STATUS_LABELS` must cover all eight wire values: `Record<ChangeRequestStatus, …>` makes a missing one a type error after `pnpm api:types`.

**Verify**: `pnpm api:types`; `pnpm exec tsc -b`; R6 has no "Đề xuất thay đổi" in the menu.

**Depends on**: BE-03..BE-07 (spec generated)

```

`types.ts` re-exports the generated component types under short names (`ChangeRequestDetail = components['schemas']['ChangeRequestDetailDto']`, …) and declares `AuthoredItemInput` as the union of the eight operation shapes — the generated type of a discriminated `ValidateNested` array is too loose to build from.

**Rationale**: As F-11 FE-02 (`src/features/outcomes/api/outcomes.ts`, `useOutcomes.ts`) and F-10's attachment calls (`f-10-…:1355-1358`) for the multipart and download pair. The shared query root mirrors F-11's `OUTCOME_QUERY_ROOT` (`src/shared/outcomes/outcomeQueryRoot.ts`) for the same reason: features invalidate each other without importing each other.

**Gotchas**
- Rule 13: re-read the `q` parameter name of `GET /courses`, `/programs`, `/subject-groups` (F-04, F-06, F-03 list DTOs) before wiring the pickers.
- `TARGET_OPTIONS_PAGE_SIZE = 20`, `TITLE_MAX`, `REASON_MAX`, `BASIS_NUMBER_MAX` live in `constants/changeRequestLimits.ts` (FE-04 creates it; FE-02 imports the page size), the last three mirrored from the backend `CHANGE_REQUEST_LIMITS`.
- The `UserSelect` query key must include `searchPath` (`['users', 'options', searchPath, q]`), or R1's `/users` results and R4's `user-options` results share a cache entry.
- `UserSelect` callers in F-03 and F-06 pass nothing and keep `/users`; record both as "left" in the FE-02 implement report row.
- The user-options endpoint returns `UserOptionDto[]`, not a page; `UserSelect` must accept both — map `Array.isArray(data) ? data : data.items`.

**Verify**: `UserSelect.test.tsx` gains one case: `searchPath="/change-requests/user-options"` requests that path. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

export function ChangeRequestListPage() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useListQuery<ChangeRequestQuery>(REQUEST_LIST_DEFAULTS);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useChangeRequests(query);
  const canCreate = useCan(PERMISSIONS.changeRequestCreate);
  const canCreateOrganizational = useCan(PERMISSIONS.changeRequestCreateOrganizational);

  if (error) return <ApiErrorResult error={error} />;
  return (
    <PageContainer
      title="Đề xuất thay đổi"
      extra={
        <Space>
          {canCreateOrganizational && <Link to={ROUTES.changeRequestOrganizationalNew}><Button>Đề xuất tổ chức</Button></Link>}
          {canCreate && <Link to={ROUTES.changeRequestNew}><Button type="primary">Tạo đề xuất</Button></Link>}
        </Space>
      }
    >
      <ChangeRequestFilters value={query} onChange={setQuery} />

        columns={REQUEST_COLUMNS}
        pagination={toPagination(data, query, setQuery)}
      />
    </PageContainer>
  );
}
```

Columns: Mã (link to `ROUTES.changeRequestDetail`), Loại (`REQUEST_TYPE_LABELS`), Đối tượng (`TargetCell`: code + name, the target type as a small grey prefix), Tiêu đề, Nguồn (`ORIGIN_LABELS`), Người tạo, Trạng thái (`RequestStatusTag`; "lần N" suffix when `submissionRound > 1`), Cập nhật (`formatDateTime`). Filters: Trạng thái, Loại, Nguồn (US-055 AC4), "Chỉ đề xuất của tôi" switch (`mine`). Filters live in the URL through the shared `useListQuery`, as the F-04 course list does.

**Rationale**: Mirrors F-04's `CourseListPage` (paged `Table`, filters in the URL) and F-06's `ProgramListPage` (`f-06-…:1119`).

**Gotchas**
- R2 holds `changeRequestCreateOrganizational` only: the page shows "Đề xuất tổ chức" and no "Tạo đề xuất" (US-060 AC3).
- `GRADING_FORMULA` stays in the type filter: F-12 requests will exist later, and an empty filter option costs nothing.
- Rule 13: `useListQuery` is the name F-04 FE gave its URL-state helper; re-read it.

**Verify**: page test — R5 sees "Tạo đề xuất" only; R2 sees "Đề xuất tổ chức" only; choosing origin "Theo yêu cầu của Trường" requests `origin=UNIVERSITY`; a round-2 row shows "lần 2". `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

`RequestDraftActions`: "Gửi duyệt" (`canSubmit`), "Xóa" (`canDelete`, `Popconfirm` `DELETE_REQUEST_CONFIRM`, then navigate to the list), "Rút" (`canWithdraw`, a returned Draft). `RequestHeaderCard` shows the header read-only with an "Sửa" toggle that swaps in `RequestHeaderForm mode="edit"` (type and target disabled). `WorkspaceCard` is FE-05; `OrganizationalItemsEditor` is FE-06.

`RequestHeaderForm` fields: Loại (`Select`; options from `types`, `UNSUPPORTED_TYPES` disabled with `UNSUPPORTED_TYPE_HINT`); Đối tượng (`TargetSelect`, its kind from `TYPE_TARGETS[type]` — a `Segmented` when two kinds are allowed); Tiêu đề; Lý do (`TextArea`); Nguồn (`Radio.Group`, `ORIGIN_LABELS`); Số văn bản căn cứ, `rules` from `requestRules.ts`:

```ts

export const basisNumberRules = (form: FormInstance<RequestHeaderValues>): Rule[] => [
  { required: form.getFieldValue('origin') === 'UNIVERSITY', whitespace: true, message: 'Nhập số văn bản căn cứ của Trường.' },

`CourseItemsEditor` (`COURSE_RELATION`): two tables edited locally, saved together with "Lưu thay đổi" → `useReplaceAuthoredItems` (the whole list, as the backend replaces it).
- "Thông tin học phần": one row per `COURSE_REQUEST_FIELDS` entry — current value, new value input (credits through the F-04 `CREDITS_PATTERN` mirror, course type `Select`, owner group `Select` of the faculty's active groups), blank new value = no item.
- "Quan hệ học phần": the course's current relations (from `GET /courses/:courseId/relations`, Rule 13 on the F-05 path) each with "Sửa ngưỡng" / "Xóa" toggles; "Thêm quan hệ" opens a small modal (other course via the course `TargetSelect`, direction, relation type, minimum score).
- Rows rebuild from `request.authoredItems` on load, so a reload shows what was saved; a `400` with `details.index` highlights that row.

`DocumentsCard`: table (Loại, Tệp → `downloadDocument`, Người tải, Thời điểm, "Đã gửi kèm lần N" when `seenInRound`), "Tải lên" (`canUpload`) opens `UploadDocumentModal` (document type `Select` + AntD `Upload` with `beforeUpload` returning `false`, accept list from the F-10 attachment rules), "Xóa" only when `canRemove`.

`DiffView` renders `ChangeDiffDto`: one `Collapse` panel per section (`title` + row count), each row a `Descriptions`-like block — tag `DIFF_CHANGE_LABELS[row.change]`, `label`, and a two-column before/after table of `fields`; long text (`WEEKLY_CONTENTS`, syllabus sections) in a scrollable `<pre>` pair. `live` → `Typography.Text type="secondary"` `LIVE_DIFF_NOTE`; no sections → `Empty` `NO_CHANGES_YET`. `RequestDiff` is the hook wrapper (`useDiff`).

```tsx
// src/features/change-requests/components/SubmitConfirmModal.tsx
interface SubmitConfirmModalProps { requestId: string; onClose: () => void }

export function SubmitConfirmModal({ requestId, onClose }: SubmitConfirmModalProps) {
  const preview = useSubmitPreview(requestId);
  const submit = useSubmitChangeRequest(requestId);
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const blocked = (preview.data?.blockingIssues.length ?? 0) > 0;

  async function onOk() {
    try {
      await submit.mutateAsync();
      navigate(generatePath(ROUTES.changeRequestDetail, { requestId }));
    } catch (error) {
      void message.error(errorMessage(error));
      void preview.refetch();
    }
  }

  return (
    <Modal open title="Gửi đề xuất đi duyệt" okText="Gửi" onOk={onOk} onCancel={onClose}
      okButtonProps={{ disabled: preview.isLoading || blocked, loading: submit.isPending }}>
      {preview.isLoading ? <PageSpin /> : <SubmitPreviewBody preview={preview.data!} />}
    </Modal>
  );
}
```

`SubmitPreviewBody`: blocking issues first (red `Alert` list, each `message`); then "N thay đổi"; "Chương trình bị ảnh hưởng" list (US-057 AC7); then three rows, one per level — level name, approvers as `name (scope)`, a skipped approver struck through with `skipReason` beside it.

**Rationale**: The create page mirrors F-06's `ProgramFormPage` (`f-06-…:1217`): AntD `Form`, `applyFieldErrors`, navigate on success. The edit page is a composer of cards like F-06's `ProgramOverviewPage` (`f-06-…:1169`). The documents card mirrors F-10's attachments tab (`f-10-…` FE-05) and uses the same `sendForm` / `downloadFile`.

**Gotchas**
- A type that needs a copy fails creation with `TARGET_NOT_RELEASED` when the target was never released; the form shows the server message on the "Đối tượng" field through `applyFieldErrors`, mapped by a `FIELD_BY_CODE = { TARGET_NOT_RELEASED: 'targetId', TYPE_TARGET_MISMATCH: 'targetId', BASIS_REQUIRED: 'basisDocumentNumber' }` table in `requestRules.ts`.
- `useSubmitPreview` runs only while the modal is open, and `staleTime: 0`: the preview must be computed now, not from a cache taken before the last edit.
- A submit that fails after a passing preview (someone released the program meanwhile) shows the error and refetches the preview, so the blocking issue appears in the same modal.
- The type list for creation is filtered: a type shows only if the user holds one of its edit permissions somewhere (`useCan` on the FE mirror of `editPermissionsFor`); the server still decides on the actual target.
- `Upload` must not auto-post: `beforeUpload` returns `false` and the modal posts on OK, so the document type travels with the file.

**Verify**: `ChangeRequestFormPage.test.tsx` — prefill from `?type=CURRICULUM&targetType=PROGRAM&targetId=p1` fills both fields; "Theo yêu cầu của Trường" without basis shows the message and posts nothing; "Công thức tính điểm" option is disabled; a conflict response shows code, creator and status, and the save button stays enabled. `ChangeRequestEditPage.test.tsx` — `canEdit: false` redirects to the detail; `COURSE_RELATION` shows the items editor, `CURRICULUM` shows the workspace card. `CourseItemsEditor.test.tsx` — credits 3 → 4 sends one `SET_COURSE_FIELD`; removing a relation sends `REMOVE_RELATION` with its id; a `400` with `details.index: 1` marks the second row. `SubmitConfirmModal.test.tsx` — blocking `STALE_BASE` disables "Gửi"; three affected programs are listed; a skipped approver shows the reason. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

**Depends on**: FE-02

### FE-05 — Working copies in the existing screens

What/Why: US-054 AC2; D1, D18. The copy is edited where the released data is shown; a banner says which request it belongs to and links back.

        { label: 'Sửa ma trận CLO–PLO', to: generatePath(ROUTES.cloPloMatrix, params) },
      ];
  }
}
```

`WorkspaceCard`: title "Soạn thay đổi", line "Dựa trên {baseLabel}", the links as buttons; `isStale` → warning `Alert` `STALE_WORKSPACE` with "Làm lại trên bản mới" (`Popconfirm` `REBASE_CONFIRM` → `useRebaseChangeRequest`).

`VersionInfoEditPage` (programs feature): loads `GET /program-versions/:versionId/info`; `canEdit` false → read-only `Descriptions`; otherwise the F-06 version fields (`programRules.ts`, `CreditsGapHint`) without code, faculty and degree level; save → `PATCH`, `applyFieldErrors`. `RequestDraftBanner` on top when `sourceRequest`.

Existing pages: each renders `<RequestDraftBanner request={data.sourceRequest} />` above its content; nothing else changes, because the read DTOs already return `canEdit` for the copy (BE-02). The syllabus pages read `requestId` from the search params, pass it to `GET /courses/:courseId/syllabus?requestId=`, keep it on every internal link (view ↔ editor), and hide the attachments tab when `draft.sourceRequest` is set.

**Rationale**: The banner is shared because four features show it and features do not import each other (react-vite §4); it mirrors the shared `ProgramSectionLinks` (`f-07-…:2004`). `VersionInfoEditPage` mirrors F-06's `ProgramFormPage` edit mode (`f-06-…:1217-1245`) with the program-level fields removed (D15).

**Gotchas**
- `CurriculumPage` and the outcome pages already take `versionId` from the path, so a copy needs no new route; Rule 13: confirm each page loads by `versionId` and does not resolve "the working version" of the program itself — a page that does would show the program's own Draft instead of the copy.
- `SyllabusEditorPage` redirects when `editPath !== 'DIRECT'` (`f-10-…:1647`); with `requestId`, BE-02 returns `DIRECT` for the creator, so the redirect still guards everyone else.
- Mutation hooks of the four features add `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: CHANGE_REQUEST_QUERY_ROOT })` — list each hook in the FE-05 implement report row (Rule 13 call sites).
- The syllabus query key gains `requestId` (`['syllabi', courseId, requestId ?? null]`), or the copy and the published view overwrite each other in the cache.
- Rule 13: `SYLLABUS_CLO_TAB` is the CLO tab key F-11 FE-07 added to `EDITOR_TABS`; re-read it, and make the editor honour `?tab=`.

**Verify**: `RequestDraftBanner.test.tsx` — null renders nothing; a ref renders the code as a link to the edit page. `WorkspaceCard.test.tsx` — `CURRICULUM` shows two links with the copy's `versionId`; `SYLLABUS_CONTENT` link carries `?requestId=`; `isStale` shows the rebase button. `VersionInfoEditPage.test.tsx` — `canEdit` false shows no inputs; 150/120/25 shows the gap hint. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

### FE-06 — Organisational request (MH-40)

**Files**

| Action | Path |
|---|---|
| NEW | `src/features/change-requests/pages/OrganizationalRequestPage.tsx` |
| NEW | `src/features/change-requests/pages/OrganizationalRequestPage.test.tsx` |
| NEW | `src/features/change-requests/components/OrganizationalItemsEditor.tsx` |
| NEW | `src/features/change-requests/components/OrganizationalItemsEditor.test.tsx` |

**Shape**: `OrganizationalRequestPage` is `ChangeRequestFormPage` with `types={['ORGANIZATION']}` fixed and the target kind chosen by a `Segmented` "Nhóm chuyên môn" / "Chương trình đào tạo" (`TYPE_TARGETS.ORGANIZATION`); on success it navigates to `ROUTES.changeRequestEdit` like the data form. `OrganizationalItemsEditor` on the edit page:
- Subject-group target: current members (from `GET /subject-groups/:id/members`, Rule 13 on the F-03 path) with "Kết thúc" (date picker → `END_MEMBERSHIP`); "Thêm thành viên" modal — `UserSelect searchPath={USER_OPTIONS_PATH}`, role (`Thành viên` / `Điều phối`), from / to dates → `ADD_MEMBER`.
- Program target: current directors with "Kết thúc" → `END_DIRECTOR`; "Phân công Giám đốc CTĐT" → `ASSIGN_DIRECTOR`.
- Saved as a whole list through `useReplaceAuthoredItems`; rows rebuilt from `authoredItems` on load.

**Rationale**: Mirrors F-03's member modal (`f-03-…:1970`) and F-06's director section (`ProgramDirectorsSection`, `f-06-…:1160`) field for field, so the payload matches the F-03 / F-06 write DTOs F-15 will apply.

**Gotchas**
- The submit preview for `ORGANIZATION` shows only the "Phòng Đào tạo" level (D16); `SubmitPreviewBody` must not render empty level-1/level-2 rows as "skipped".
- Dates go over the wire as `YYYY-MM-DD` (`dayjs().format(DATE_WIRE_FORMAT)`), never ISO timestamps — the backend compares days.
- R4 sees only their own groups in the target picker because `GET /subject-groups` is scoped; a group outside it still answers `OUT_OF_SCOPE` on create (US-060 AC4).

**Verify**: page test — target kind toggle switches the picker; `OrganizationalItemsEditor.test.tsx` — adding a coordinator sends `ADD_MEMBER` with `memberRole: 'COORDINATOR'` and date strings; the user picker requests `/change-requests/user-options`. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

### FE-07 — Detail (MH-41) and "Tạo đề xuất" on every screen

What/Why: The read-only page everyone with visibility opens (US-055 AC3, US-057 AC2, US-059), and the change that turns every disabled "Tạo đề xuất" left by F-04..F-11 into a link (US-053 AC1).

export function requestFormLink({ type, targetType, targetId }: RequestPrefill): string {
  return `${ROUTES.changeRequestNew}?${new URLSearchParams({ type, targetType, targetId })}`;
}
```

```tsx
// src/shared/change-requests/CreateRequestButton.tsx
interface CreateRequestButtonProps { prefill: RequestPrefill; label?: string }

// Shown where editPath is VIA_REQUEST; the request form decides what the user may actually create.
export function CreateRequestButton({ prefill, label = 'Tạo đề xuất' }: CreateRequestButtonProps) {
  const canCreate = useCan(PERMISSIONS.changeRequestCreate);
  if (!canCreate) return null;
  return <Link to={requestFormLink(prefill)}><Button icon={<FileSyncOutlined />}>{label}</Button></Link>;
}
```

**Call sites — the deliverable** (Rule 13): every disabled "Tạo đề xuất" and every use of `CHANGE_REQUEST_PENDING_TOOLTIP`.

| Caller | Cite | Prefill | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CourseEditButton` | `f-04-…:1386` | `COURSE_RELATION`, `COURSE`, course id | migrated → `CreateRequestButton` |
| F-05 relations section | `f-05-…:1294` | `COURSE_RELATION`, `COURSE`, course id | migrated |
| `ProgramEditButton` | `f-06-…:1194` | `PROGRAM_INFO`, `PROGRAM`, program id | migrated |
| `CurriculumAddButton` | `f-07-…:1759` | `CURRICULUM`, `PROGRAM`, program id | migrated |
| `ElectiveGroupsPage` add button | `f-07-…:1907` | `CURRICULUM`, `PROGRAM`, program id | migrated (Rule 13: confirm it shows the tooltip) |
| `SyllabusPage` "Tạo đề xuất" | `f-10-…:162` (`editPath`) | `SYLLABUS_CONTENT`, `COURSE`, course id | migrated |
| `SyllabusEditorPage` `NOT_DIRECTLY_EDITABLE` result | `f-10-…:1647` | — | left: it is reached only by URL; the syllabus page now offers the button |
| `PloListPage` `NOT_DIRECTLY_EDITABLE` alert | `f-11-…:1482` | `OUTCOME`, `PROGRAM`, program id | migrated: the alert gains the button as `action` |
| `CoursePloMatrixPage`, `ProgramCloPloPage` | F-11 FE-04, FE-05 | `OUTCOME`, `PROGRAM`, program id | migrated, same as above |
| `CHANGE_REQUEST_PENDING_TOOLTIP` | `f-04-…:1232` | — | deleted once the rows above are migrated; `grep -r CHANGE_REQUEST_PENDING_TOOLTIP src` returns nothing |

```tsx
// src/features/change-requests/components/StepProgress.tsx
interface StepProgressProps { steps: readonly ApprovalStep[] }

// One column per level; one line per approver row, so two coordinators show two lines (EC-22).
export function StepProgress({ steps }: StepProgressProps) {
  const levels = groupByLevel(steps);
  return (
    <Row gutter={16}>
      {levels.map(({ approvalLevel, levelName, rows }) => (
        <Col key={approvalLevel} xs={24} md={8}>
          <Card size="small" title={`Cấp ${approvalLevel} — ${levelName}`}>
            {rows.map((row) => <StepLine key={row.id} step={row} />)}
          </Card>
        </Col>
      ))}
    </Row>
  );
}
```

`StepLine`: approver name (or "Phòng Đào tạo" / "—"), the group or program it stands for, then a tag — `isSkipped` → grey "Bỏ qua" with `skipReason` in a tooltip; else `ACTION_LABELS[action]` (`PENDING` "Chờ duyệt", `APPROVE` "Đã duyệt", `RETURN` "Trả lại", `REJECT` "Từ chối") with `recordedAt`; `remark` below when present.

`ChangeRequestDetailPage`: header `Descriptions` (mã, loại, đối tượng with a link to its screen, tiêu đề, lý do, nguồn, số văn bản căn cứ, người tạo, lần gửi, trạng thái); `ConflictAlert`; `StepProgress` (hidden before the first submit); `DiffView` through `RequestDiff`; `DocumentsCard` read-only except `canUpload` while pending (US-056 AC2–AC3); actions — "Tiếp tục soạn" (`canEdit`, link to the edit page), "Rút đề xuất" (`canWithdraw`, `Popconfirm` `WITHDRAW_CONFIRM`). F-14 adds the approve / return / reject panel to this page.

**Rationale**: `StepProgress` mirrors AntD's `Card` grid used by F-06's overview sections; the button helper mirrors F-07's shared `ProgramSectionLinks` (`f-07-…:2004`) — one shared builder so every screen links the same way. The call-site table mirrors F-11's migration table (`f-11-…:455-462`).

**Gotchas**
- `CreateRequestButton` is hidden for users without `changeRequestCreate` (R2 sees `VIA_REQUEST` on some screens but files only organisational requests).
- Authored items (`COURSE_RELATION`, `ORGANIZATION`) reach the detail through `DiffView`: BE-05's presenter turns them into diff sections, so the page has no separate items list.
- The detail page is the landing page after submit and withdraw; both mutations already put the new detail in the cache (FE-02), so it renders without a refetch flash.
- `generatePath` throws on a missing param; the target link builds from `target.targetType` and must handle `SUBJECT_GROUP` (F-03 group detail route) as well.

**Verify**: `requestFormLink.test.ts` — the three params are encoded. `StepProgress.test.tsx` — two coordinators of one group render two lines; a skipped row shows "Bỏ qua" and its reason; level 3 with no approver shows "Phòng Đào tạo". `ChangeRequestDetailPage.test.tsx` — R4 viewing another's pending request sees no actions; the creator of a pending request with a non-skipped `APPROVE` row sees no "Rút" (`canWithdraw` false); `canEdit` shows "Tiếp tục soạn". `grep -r CHANGE_REQUEST_PENDING_TOOLTIP src` is empty. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

## 8. Risks and open items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| The guard swap touches every write path of F-07, F-08, F-10, F-11 | A missed call site either blocks copies or opens released data | BE-02 call-site table is the deliverable; pause P1 re-runs every earlier suite before anything else lands |
| A copy is readable by id to anyone who may read its target (D18) | A colleague who learns the id sees an unsubmitted draft | Ids are only reachable from the request; if review objects, add `assertCopyReadable` to the four readers |
| Any copy page is writable by its creator, whatever the request type | A `CURRICULUM` request could also change PLOs through a typed URL | The diff shows every change and approvers see it; tighten by passing the request type into `assertEditPath` if it is abused |
| Authored items are applied later by F-15 with the owning feature's full checks | An approved request can fail at apply (overlap, cycle, credit sum) | **Constraint for F-15:** apply each authored item through the owning feature's shared writer, report a failed item with its label, and keep the request `APPROVED` (not `EFFECTIVE`) until it applies |
| Prisma accessor `tx.cLO`, `createManyAndReturn` | Copier does not compile | Rule 13 at BE-03 against the generated client |
| `Map.groupBy` typing | Type error | Rule 13 on `tsconfig` lib; reduce fallback |
| Request code sequence never resets | Numbers keep growing across years | Accepted (D13); the year in the code is for reading |
| **Constraint for F-14:** approval actions | Steps exist with `PENDING`; nothing moves them | F-14 approves / returns / rejects per row of the current `submissionRound`; level complete = every non-skipped row `APPROVE`; next status from the next level with a `PENDING` row (`PENDING_STATUS_BY_LEVEL`); Return sets status `DRAFT` and leaves the round, so resubmit increments it; every approval count filters `isSkipped: false`; replace every `returnForTest` call; the approval panel goes on `ChangeRequestDetailPage` and the queue (MH-42) in the same frontend feature, reusing `DiffView` and `StepProgress`; level 3 has no `approverId` — any active R1 other than the creator acts on it |
| **Constraint for F-14:** visibility | Approvers of a returned Draft must still see it | `visibleWhere` already admits round ≥ 1 and step holders; F-14 keeps the approver condition on `steps.some.approverId` and adds "any R1" for level 3 |
| **Constraint for F-15:** release | The request copy is the next version / revision | F-15 promotes the copy: numbers it (`versionNumber`, `revisionNumber`), sets `previousVersionId`, clears `sourceRequestId` only if the two partial indexes and every copy filter stay correct — or keeps it and adds `status <> 'DRAFT'` to the filters; re-points CLO–PLO links of the program to the new syllabus CLO ids by `cloCode`; re-runs `StaleChecker` at release and refuses a stale request; adds `decisionNumber`, `signedDate`, `effectiveSemester` to `ChangeRequest` |
| **Constraint for F-15:** discarding copies | A rejected or withdrawn request keeps its copy | F-15 (or F-14 on reject) decides whether to delete the copy at `REJECTED` / `WITHDRAWN` through `WorkingCopyService.discard`; until then copies of closed requests stay, read-only through `REQUEST_NOT_DRAFT` |
| **Constraint for F-09:** Excel import | Import into a copy would bypass review | `assertCurriculumImport` keeps refusing any version with `sourceRequestId` |
| **Constraint for F-12:** grading formula | `GRADING_FORMULA` refused by `CREATABLE_TYPES` | F-12 adds the type, its workspace (the syllabus copy's assessments) and the "CLO not assessed" submit block (US-057 AC5) |
