# F-14 Three-Level Approval and Notifications — Backend + Frontend Implementation Plan

This plan builds EP-14 (FR-57 decision half, FR-58 display, FR-59, FR-61 enforcement, FR-62, FR-63, FR-65, FR-67): the "waiting for me" queue of coordinators, program directors and the academic office (MH-42, US-061); the approval panel on the request detail page with Approve, Return and Reject at each of the three levels (US-062..US-065); refusing a decision on one's own request (US-066 AC5); comments that never block (US-067); in-app notifications with a 60-second poll that does not keep the session alive (US-068, MH-04); the approval history of every round (US-069); the academic office's override at levels 1 and 2 and the backlog filter of the request list (US-070); and applying an approved organisational request at once (US-060 AC2).

It deliberately excludes final approval of data requests — decision number, signed date, effective semester, creating the new version (MH-43, F-15); e-mail notifications (FR-64, B6 EP-25); reminders for overdue requests (FR-66, optional, B6); delegation of approval (B6, `ApprovalDelegation`); a configurable number of levels per request type (F14-03: every request goes through three levels); and the audit log (F01-07).

## 0. Plan at a glance

Everything below in one table. Read this; the rest is detail for whoever builds it.

| What | Why | How and where |
|---|---|---|
| **"Chờ tôi duyệt": every approver sees exactly the requests waiting for them, with days waiting** | US-061; FR-65; MH-42 | `GET /approval-queue` reads the caller's PENDING rows of the current round at the request's current level, plus every level-3 request for the academic office; `ChangeRequest.levelEnteredAt` gives the days (BE-01, BE-08, FE-05) |
| **Approve, Return, Reject on the detail page, at each of the three levels** | US-062..US-065; FR-59; F14-01 | `ApprovalPanel` on MH-41 with a remark modal; `POST /change-requests/:id/approve|return|reject` (BE-04, FE-03) |
| **A level passes only when every approver of that level has approved; one Return sends the request back at once** | US-063 AC1–AC2, US-064 AC1–AC3; EC-22, EC-23 | Shared `ApprovalRecorder` claims the request, records the caller's rows, advances to the next level with a PENDING row (BE-04) |
| **Return and Reject need a reason of at least 20 characters; Return goes to Draft and the resubmit starts at level 1** | BR-28, BR-29; KB-047..KB-049 | DTO rule + status DRAFT with the round unchanged; F-13's submit already restarts at level 1 (BE-04) |
| **Nobody decides on their own request** | US-066 AC5; BR-27; KB-052 | `SELF_APPROVAL` refused before any row is read; the creator's own rows are already skipped by F-13's routing (BE-04) |
| **An approved organisational request changes the group or the director assignment at once** | US-060 AC2 | Level-3 approval applies its items through writers extracted from F-03 and F-06, in the same transaction; status EFFECTIVE (BE-03, BE-04) |
| **The academic office overrides a stuck level 1 or 2, with a reason, and the history says who should have acted** | US-070; BR-31; EC-25, EC-28; KB-053 | `POST /change-requests/:id/override`; rows marked `isOverride` with `performedById`; backlog filter "chờ quá N ngày" on the request list (BE-05, FE-03, FE-07) |
| **Comments by anyone who can see the request, never changing its status** | US-067; FR-62; F14-04 | `Comment` table, `GET|POST /change-requests/:id/comments` (BE-01, BE-06, FE-04) |
| **Full approval history, every round** | US-069; FR-67 | `GET /change-requests/:id/history` grouped by round, each row labelled normal / skipped / override (BE-06, FE-04) |
| **In-app notifications with a bell and a page; polling does not keep an idle session alive** | US-068; FR-63; F14-10; NFR-08 and F-01's constraint | `Notification` written in the same transaction as each event; bell polls every 60 s and on page change; `@PassiveRequest()` + `lastActivityAt` in the session (BE-02, BE-07, FE-06) |

**Key behaviours worth knowing**

| Behaviour | Why it is this way |
|---|---|
| Every decision first claims the request row with a conditional update on its id, status and round | Two coordinators approving at the same moment would each see the other's row still PENDING and both leave the request at level 1; the claim serialises them |
| An approver who stands for two groups (or two programs) decides both rows with one click | Routing creates one row per group / program (F-13 D7); asking the same person twice is noise |
| After a Return, the other approvers' PENDING rows of that round stay PENDING and are dead | S-4 "không còn hiệu lực"; every reader of PENDING rows matches the request's round **and** status, so they leave every queue at once |
| Level 3 has one row with no named approver; any active R1 who did not create the request acts on it | F-13 D8; F13-01 |
| At level 3 a data request can be returned or rejected here, but approving it is F-15's final-approval form | DX-10 needs decision number, signed date and effective semester (MH-43); this plan answers `FINAL_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` |
| An organisational request whose item no longer applies (member already ended, overlap) is refused as a whole and stays at level 3 | One transaction; the error names the item; R1 then returns or rejects it |
| Override decides **every** PENDING row of the current level and keeps `approverId` | US-070 AC1: the level counts as passed and the history names who should have approved |
| A notification is written in the same transaction as the event that causes it | A rolled-back approval never leaves a notification behind |
| The actor of an event is never notified of it | Their own click is not news |
| The unread-count poll is marked passive: it neither renews the idle timer nor counts as activity | F-01 §8 constraint; NFR-08 — a tab left open must still log out after 60 idle minutes |
| A session created before this deploy has no `lastActivityAt`; the guard treats it as active now | Avoids logging everyone out on deploy |
| Comments are allowed in every status, including closed requests | FR-62 "không làm đổi trạng thái ở bất kỳ trạng thái nào" |

**Not included**

| Excluded | Why |
|---|---|
| Final approval of data requests (MH-43), new version, effective semester | F-15 |
| E-mail notifications (FR-64) | SHOULD; B6 EP-25 |
| Reminders for overdue requests (FR-66) | Optional; B6. The backlog filter covers US-070 AC4 |
| Delegation of approval (EC-25 first half) | B6 `ApprovalDelegation` |
| Withdrawal notifying the pending approvers | No acceptance criterion asks for it; the request simply leaves their queue |
| Deleting old notifications | No retention rule in the requirements; volume is small (§8) |
| Real-time push (WebSocket / SSE) | F14-10 A: poll |
| Audit log rows for decisions | F01-07; `ApprovalStep` and the `Logger` are the record |

---

## 1. Scope

| In scope | Why |
|---|---|
| `Comment`, `Notification`; `ChangeRequest.levelEnteredAt` | DD §6; days waiting |
| Passive requests and the idle limit from `lastActivityAt` | F-01 §8 constraint; NFR-08 |
| Shared membership and director writers; F-03 and F-06 services delegate to them | US-060 AC2 apply with the owning feature's rules |
| Approve, Return, Reject; level advance; organisational apply at level 3 | US-062..US-065, US-060 AC2 |
| Override at levels 1–2; backlog filter on MH-38 | US-070 |
| Comments; history of every round | US-067, US-069 |
| Notifications: write, list, unread count, mark read | US-068; MH-04 |
| Queue MH-42 | US-061 |
| F-13's submit sets `levelEnteredAt` and notifies level-1 (or first pending) approvers | US-068 AC1; FR-63 |
| `returnForTest` replaced by the real Return | F-13 §8 constraint |

| Out of scope | Deferred until |
|---|---|
| Final approval and release of data requests | F-15 |
| E-mail, reminders | B6 |
| Delegation | B6 |
| Discarding the working copy of a rejected request | F-15 (§8 constraint) |

| AC | Covered by |
|---|---|
| US-061 AC1 — R4 sees level-1 requests of their group not yet handled | BE-08 (`ApprovalQueueReader`), FE-05 |
| US-061 AC2 — R3 sees level-2 requests of their programs | BE-08, FE-05 |
| US-061 AC3 — columns code, title, type, creator, submitted, days waiting; sort, filter by type | BE-08 (`ApprovalQueueItemDto`, `?requestType`), FE-05 |
| US-061 AC4 — handled request leaves the queue | BE-08 (PENDING rows of the current round only), BE-09 test |
| US-062 AC1–AC3 — detail with before/after, documents, progress | F-13 `DiffView`, `DocumentsCard`, `StepProgress`; FE-03 places the panel |
| US-062 AC4 — R5 who is not an approver sees no action buttons | BE-04 (`permissions.canApprove` etc.), FE-03 |
| US-063 AC1 — single coordinator approves → `PENDING_DIRECTOR` | BE-04 (`ApprovalRecorder.advance`), BE-09 |
| US-063 AC2 — two coordinators: stays at level 1, shows who approved | BE-04, F-13 `StepProgress`, BE-09 |
| US-063 AC3 — remark under 20 characters refused | BE-04 (`DecisionRemarkDto`), FE-03 (`RemarkModal` rule), BE-09 (KB-047) |

| US-063 AC5 — Reject → REJECTED, cannot resubmit | BE-04; F-13 `findOwnDraft` (`REQUEST_NOT_DRAFT`) |
| US-063 AC6 — another group's request refused | BE-04 (`NOT_YOUR_STEP`), BE-09 |
| US-064 AC1 — one program → `PENDING_ACADEMIC_OFFICE` | BE-04, BE-09 |
| US-064 AC2 — three programs wait for all three directors | BE-04 (level complete only without PENDING rows), BE-09 (KB-042 approval half) |
| US-064 AC3 — one director returns → DRAFT at once | BE-04 (Return does not wait for the level), BE-09 |
| US-064 AC4 — not their program → refused | BE-04 (`NOT_YOUR_STEP`) |
| US-065 AC1 — level-3 Return → DRAFT, resubmit from level 1 | BE-04, F-13 submit, BE-09 (KB-049) |
| US-065 AC2 — level-3 Reject → REJECTED | BE-04 |
| US-065 AC3 — creator and lower-level approvers notified with the reason | BE-07 (`RequestNotifier.decided`), BE-09 |
| US-066 AC1–AC4 — skip of the creator's own row | F-13 BE-07 (routing); BE-09 re-checks KB-050, KB-051 end to end |
| US-066 AC5 — direct call on own request refused | BE-04 (`SELF_APPROVAL`), BE-05, BE-09 (KB-052) |
| US-067 AC1 — R2 comments, no action buttons | BE-06, BE-04 (`permissions`), FE-03, FE-04, BE-09 (NT-B4-07) |
| US-067 AC2 — author, time, chronological | BE-06 (`orderBy createdAt asc`), FE-04 |
| US-067 AC3 — no edit or delete | BE-06 (no routes), BE-01 (no `updatedAt`) |
| US-067 AC4 — comments never block | BE-06 (no status change, any status) |
| US-068 AC1 — arriving at a level notifies every approver of it, with a link | BE-07 (`RequestNotifier.arrived`), F-13 submit call site (BE-07), FE-06 |
| US-068 AC2 — returned / rejected / approved notifies the creator with result and reason | BE-07 |
| US-068 AC3 — new comment notifies creator and current approvers | BE-06 + BE-07 (`RequestNotifier.commented`) |
| US-068 AC4 — opening a notification marks it read; count drops | BE-07 (`POST /notifications/:id/read`), FE-06 |
| US-069 AC1 — level, actor, action, remark, time per step | BE-06 (`ApprovalHistoryDto`), FE-04 |
| US-069 AC2 — grouped by round, earlier rounds kept | BE-06, FE-04 |
| US-069 AC3 — distinct labels for skip / override | BE-06 (`kind`), FE-04 (delegation is B6) |
| US-069 AC4 — no edit or delete | No route; decided rows are never updated (BE-04 claims only PENDING rows) |
| US-070 AC1 — R1 overrides level 1 or 2; history names who should have approved | BE-05, FE-03, FE-04 |
| US-070 AC2 — reason required | BE-05 (`OverrideDecisionDto`), FE-03 |
| US-070 AC3 — refused on own request | BE-05 (`SELF_APPROVAL`) |
| US-070 AC4 — system-wide list filtered by days waiting | BE-08 (`minDaysWaiting` on `GET /change-requests`), FE-07 |
| US-060 AC2 — organisational change applied on approval | BE-03, BE-04 (`OrganizationalApplier`), BE-09 |

All under the global `/api` prefix, all requiring a session.

| Endpoint | Permission | Request | Response | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /change-requests/:id/approve` | `changeRequest.view` + actor rule (BE-04) | `ApproveDecisionDto` | `ChangeRequestDetailDto` | 403 `SELF_APPROVAL`, `NOT_YOUR_STEP`; 409 `REQUEST_STATE_CHANGED`, `FINAL_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` (data request at level 3), `ORGANIZATION_APPLY_FAILED`, `STALE_BASE` |

| `GET /notifications` | any authenticated | `NotificationQueryDto` | `NotificationPageDto` | own rows only; newest first |
| `GET /notifications/unread-count` | any authenticated, **passive** | — | `UnreadCountDto` | does not renew the idle timer |
| `POST /notifications/:id/read` | any authenticated | — | `NotificationDto` | 404 `NOTIFICATION_NOT_FOUND` for another user's row; idempotent |
| `POST /notifications/read-all` | any authenticated | — | `UnreadCountDto` | returns `{ count: 0 }` |

### 2c. Mismatch log

| Deliverable | What the earlier doc said | What this plan does | Found at |
|---|---|---|---|
| BE-01 | DD `Comment.recordedAt` | `createdAt` like every other table | `data-dictionary.md:627`; F-13 did the same for documents |
| BE-01 | DD `Notification.link` (string, optional), `recordedAt`, `emailSent` | No `link`: the FE builds the link from `changeRequestId`, so a route rename never leaves dead links in old rows. `createdAt` + `readAt` instead of `recordedAt`. `emailSent` not added (FR-64 is B6) | `data-dictionary.md:638-649` |
| BE-01 | DD `Notification.notificationType` is a free string | Enum `NotificationType` with six values | every type is produced by this plan; an enum keeps the FE icon map total |
| BE-01 | DD `ChangeRequest` has no time-at-level column | ⊕ `levelEnteredAt DateTime?` | US-061 AC3, US-070 AC4 need days waiting; deriving it from step rows needs the previous level's last decision per request |
| BE-04 | State diagram: `APPROVED → EFFECTIVE` only "tới đầu học kỳ hiệu lực" (DX-11) | An `ORGANIZATION` request goes `PENDING_ACADEMIC_OFFICE → EFFECTIVE` directly on level-3 approval | US-060 AC2 "áp dụng ngay"; it has no version and no semester |
| BE-04 | US-060 AC2 "có dòng nhật ký" | No audit log (F01-07); the `ApprovalStep` row, the applied rows' `assignedById`, and a `Logger` line are the record | `feature-questions.md` F01-07 |
| BE-04 | State diagram BD-03: the actor may be the approver, a delegate "hoặc R1" on any row | Approve / Return / Reject act only on the caller's own rows (level 3: any R1); R1 acting on someone else's row goes through the explicit override (BE-05) | BR-31, US-070: override must carry a reason and be labelled; a plain click by R1 would be neither |
| BE-07 | F-13 `SubmissionService.submit` writes no notification and no `levelEnteredAt` | F-14 modifies `submit` to set `levelEnteredAt` and notify the first pending level | US-068 AC1 |
| BE-09 | F-13 BE-08 `returnForTest` sets status DRAFT directly | Deleted; its one call uses `POST /change-requests/:id/return` | `f-13-…:2161`, `:2185` |
| FE-01 | Screen inventory: menu "Phê duyệt › Chờ tôi duyệt" (nested), shown to R1, R3, R4 only | A flat entry "Chờ tôi duyệt" gated by `changeRequestView`: F-02's `AppMenuItem` has no children, and no permission marks "is an approver" (approval is decided per row) — R2 and R5 see an empty queue | `screen-inventory.md:260`; `f-02-…:2330-2343` |
| FE-01 | F-13 FE-01 adds its menu entry as `{ key, label, icon, permission }` | F-02's `AppMenuItem` is `{ path, label, permission? }`; F-14 uses that shape and F-13's line is corrected to it in the same change | `f-13-…:2253`; `f-02-…:2330-2335` |
| FE-06 | MH-04 lists notifications; the bell is not in the screen inventory | Bell with unread badge in the `AppLayout` header plus MH-04 | US-068 AC4 "số thông báo chưa đọc giảm một" needs a visible count |

## 3. Decisions

| # | Decision | Why | Rejected alternative |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Approve / Return / Reject / override live in the change-requests feature (`ApprovalService`); claiming the request, recording rows and advancing the level live in a shared `ApprovalRecorder` (`src/shared/change-requests/`) | F-15's final approval records the level-3 row and moves the status under the same rules; features do not import each other | All in the feature — F-15 would duplicate the level rules |
| D2 | Every decision starts with a conditional `updateMany` on the request (`id`, `status`, `submissionRound`) | Serialises decisions on one request: the second approver's transaction waits on the row lock and then reads the first's committed row, so "last approver of the level" is always seen | `SERIALIZABLE` isolation with retries — more code for the same effect |
| D3 | A decision covers every PENDING row of the caller at the current level and round | A coordinator of two affected groups has two rows (F-13 D7); one click decides both | One row per click — the same person approves twice |
| D4 | Level complete = no PENDING row at that level in the round; the next status is the lowest higher level with a PENDING row; none → complete | Skipped rows are APPROVE at submit (F14-09); the rows already say which levels remain (F-13 D6) | Counting approvals against an expected number — the rows already are the expectation |
| D5 | Level 3 here: Return and Reject for every type; Approve only for `ORGANIZATION`. A data request answers `FINAL_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` and waits for F-15's MH-43 | DX-10 requires decision number, signed date, effective semester and creates versions | A plain level-3 Approve that leaves the request APPROVED without a decision — DX-10's conditions would be skipped |
| D6 | `ORGANIZATION` level-3 approval applies the items in item order, in the decision's transaction, through shared writers; any failure refuses the whole approval with the item label; success → EFFECTIVE | US-060 AC2 "áp dụng ngay"; the writers carry F-03 / F-06's overlap and coverage rules | Applying later in a job — "ngay" and a failure nobody sees |
| D7 | Return → DRAFT with the round unchanged; Reject → REJECTED. The other PENDING rows of that round are left as they are | BR-29 (F-13 submit increments the round); S-4: they are dead because every reader matches round **and** status | Marking them RETURN — would claim people decided who did not |
| D8 | Remark: required ≥ `REMARK_MIN` = 20 characters after trimming for Return, Reject and override; optional for Approve; ≤ `REMARK_MAX` = 2000 | BR-28; US-070 AC2 | Counting untrimmed — 20 spaces would pass |
| D9 | `performedById` is set on every decided row to whoever acted; `isOverride` marks R1 acting on someone else's row; `approverId` never changes | History needs "ai làm thay ai" (US-069 AC3) and level-3 rows have no `approverId` | Setting `performedById` only on overrides — level 3 would have no actor |
| D10 | Override is a separate route, R1 only (`changeRequest.override`), levels 1–2 only, decides every PENDING row of the level with one action and one reason | US-070 AC1–AC3; at level 3 R1 is the approver already | Letting R1 click Approve on any row — no reason, no label |
| D11 | Level-3 actor = holder of an active R1 role assignment (`academicOfficeHoldersWhere`), the same query F-13's routing uses, extracted to `src/shared/change-requests/academic-office.ts` | The routing decided "another R1 exists" with this query; the decision must agree with it | Using `access.has(CHANGE_REQUEST_OVERRIDE)` — a permission, not the office |
| D12 | `ChangeRequest.levelEnteredAt` set on submit and on every level change; cleared when the request leaves `PENDING_*` | Days waiting in the queue and the backlog filter become one column read | Deriving from step rows per request at read time |
| D13 | Queue at `GET /approval-queue`, not paged; candidate rows by SQL, round / level match in code | A queue holds tens of rows; Prisma cannot compare a step's round with its request's round in one `where` | `GET /change-requests/queue` — collides with F-13's `:id` route by registration order |
| D14 | Notifications are rows written in the event's transaction by a shared `NotificationService`; recipients deduplicated and the actor removed; content built in Vietnamese when written | A rolled-back event leaves nothing; the text is what the reader saw at the time | Writing after commit — a crash between the two loses the notification |
| D15 | The bell polls `GET /notifications/unread-count` every `NOTIFICATION_POLL_MS` = 60 000 and on every route change; the route is `@PassiveRequest()` | F14-10 A; F-01 §8 | WebSocket / SSE (F14-10 B) |
| D16 | The guard enforces the idle limit from `session.lastActivityAt`; non-passive requests update it; a missing value counts as now | The cookie's rolling `maxAge` is renewed by every response including polls, so it can no longer be the idle clock | Turning `rolling` off — every active user would be logged out 60 minutes after login |
| D17 | Comments: no update or delete route, any status, author needs `changeRequest.comment` and must see the request | US-067 AC3–AC4; FR-62 | Allowing edits within a grace period — not asked for |
| D18 | Writers for membership and director assignments move to `src/shared/subject-groups/membership.writer.ts` and `src/shared/programs/director.writer.ts`, taking a transaction client; F-03 and F-06 services delegate | The change-requests feature cannot import F-03 / F-06; one implementation keeps the overlap and coverage rules in one place | Re-implementing the rules in the applier — two copies drift |
| D19 | Recipient rules live in a shared `RequestNotifier` (`src/shared/change-requests/request-notifier.ts`) on top of a generic `NotificationService` (`src/shared/notifications/`) | F-13's submit (feature), F-14's decisions and F-15's final approval and activation all notify; one place answers "who hears about this" | Each caller computing its own recipients |

### BE-01 — Schema: comments, notifications, time at level

export const REMARK_MAX = 2000;
export const COMMENT_MAX = 2000;

// src/shared/notifications/notification.constants.ts
export const NOTIFICATION_PAGE_SIZE_MAX = 50;
```

**Rationale**: Table layout mirrors F-13's `ChangeRequestDocument` (`f-13-…:499`): cascade from the request, `createdAt` instead of the data dictionary's `recordedAt`. The index on `Notification` serves the unread count (`recipientId, readStatus`) and the newest-first page (`createdAt`) with one index.

**Gotchas**
- `Comment` has no `updatedAt` on purpose: nothing updates it (US-067 AC3).
- `Notification.changeRequest` cascades: F-13 can delete a never-submitted draft, and a draft that was never submitted has produced no notifications anyway; the cascade keeps the FK honest.
- `levelEnteredAt` stays null for every existing row; F-13 is unbuilt, so there is no data to backfill. If F-13 ships to a shared database before F-14, the migration sets `levelEnteredAt = updatedAt` for rows in `PENDING_*` (one `UPDATE` in the same migration).
- `content` holds the rendered sentence; a request renamed later does not rewrite old notifications.

**Verify**: `pnpm exec prisma migrate dev --name approval_comments_notifications`; `pnpm exec prisma generate`; the migration SQL creates two enums, two tables, one column and three indexes and nothing else. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

### BE-02 — Passive requests and the idle limit

| MODIFY | `src/shared/auth/authenticated.guard.spec.ts` |

**Shape**

```ts
// src/shared/session/session-data.ts
declare module 'express-session' {
  interface SessionData {
    userId: string;
    lastActivityAt: number;
  }
}
```

```ts
// src/shared/session/session-lifecycle.ts — startSession sets the clock with the user id
request.session.userId = userId;
request.session.lastActivityAt = Date.now();
```

```ts
// src/shared/session/passive-request.decorator.ts
import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const IS_PASSIVE_REQUEST_KEY = 'isPassiveRequest';

// Background polls: authenticated, but neither renew nor count as user activity for the idle limit.
export const PassiveRequest = () => SetMetadata(IS_PASSIVE_REQUEST_KEY, true);
```

```ts
// src/shared/auth/authenticated.guard.ts
@Injectable()
export class AuthenticatedGuard implements CanActivate {
  private readonly idleMs: number;

  constructor(
    private readonly reflector: Reflector,
    private readonly prisma: PrismaService,
    config: ConfigService<EnvConfig, true>,
  ) {
    this.idleMs = config.get('SESSION_IDLE_MINUTES', { infer: true }) * MS_PER_MINUTE;
  }

  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    if (this.isMarked(context, IS_PUBLIC_KEY)) return true;
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest<Request>();
    const session = request.session;
    if (!session?.userId) throw new AppException(COMMON_ERRORS.SESSION_REQUIRED);

    // The cookie is rolling, so every response — polls included — renews it; this clock is the idle limit.
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - (session.lastActivityAt ?? now) > this.idleMs) {
      await endSession(session);
      throw new AppException(COMMON_ERRORS.SESSION_REQUIRED);
    }

    // …F-01's user re-read, inactive → endSession, mustChangePassword check, request.user — unchanged

    if (!this.isMarked(context, IS_PASSIVE_REQUEST_KEY)) session.lastActivityAt = now;
    return true;
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Keeps F-01's guard as the one place that decides "is this session alive" (`f-01-…:1000-1051`); the decorator mirrors F-01's `@Public()` (`IS_PUBLIC_KEY`) and F-02's `@AnyAuthenticated()`. The constant `MS_PER_MINUTE` and the env key are F-01's (`f-01-…:680`, `:727`).

**Gotchas**
- `?? now` treats a session written before this deploy as active now; it gains a clock on its next non-passive request.
- Setting `lastActivityAt` marks the session modified, so the store writes it; passive requests do not modify it. With `rolling: true` the store's expiry is still touched by every response, which is why the clock lives in the session and not in the store TTL.
- The check runs before the user re-read so an idle session costs no query.
- Logout and login are `@Public()`; neither passes through this check.
- A guard spec that builds the guard by hand needs the new `ConfigService` argument.

**Verify**: `authenticated.guard.spec.ts` — session with `lastActivityAt` 61 minutes ago → `SESSION_REQUIRED` and `endSession` called; 59 minutes ago → allowed and `lastActivityAt` set to now; a passive route 59 minutes ago → allowed and `lastActivityAt` unchanged; a passive route 61 minutes ago → `SESSION_REQUIRED`; no `lastActivityAt` → allowed. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

### BE-03 — Shared membership and director writers

What/Why: US-060 AC2 applies organisational items from the change-requests feature, which may not import F-03 or F-06 (nestjs-rules §1); D18. Replacing two shared service methods' bodies makes their call sites a deliverable (Rule 13).

```ts

  const row = await addMembership(this.prisma, groupId, dto, actorId);

  const today = todayDate();
  return changed.map((member) => toSubjectGroupMemberDto(member, today));
}
```

**Call sites of the moved logic**

| Call site | After this deliverable |
|---|---|
| `SubjectGroupMembersService.add` (F-03) | migrated — delegates to `addMembership(this.prisma, …)` |
| `SubjectGroupMembersService.end` (F-03) | migrated — delegates to `endMembership(tx, …)` in an interactive transaction |
| `SubjectGroupMembersService.revoke` (F-03) | left — revoking is not an organisational request operation; it keeps its private `findLiveOrThrow` and `coordinatorRowsInside`, which now call the writer module's exported `findLiveMember` and `coordinatorRowsInside` |
| `ProgramDirectorsService.assign` (F-06) | migrated — delegates to `assignDirector` |
| `ProgramDirectorsService.end` (F-06) | migrated — delegates to `endDirector` |
| `ProgramDirectorsService.revoke` (F-06) | left — not a request operation; uses the writer module's exported `findLiveAssignment` |
| `OrganizationalApplier` (BE-04) | new caller |

**Rationale**: Plain functions over a `Db` handle, like F-08's `lockRequisiteGraph(tx)` and F-13's `newestReleasedVersion(db, …)`: no module wiring, and the caller owns the transaction. The bodies are F-03 BE-03 (`f-03-…:1089-1200`) and F-06 BE-03 (`f-06-…:468-525`) moved, not rewritten.

**Gotchas**
- Error codes must not change: the FE maps them and F-03 / F-06 e2e tests assert them. Spreading the shared constants into the feature constants keeps `SUBJECT_GROUP_ERRORS.MEMBERSHIP_OVERLAP` valid at every existing call site.
- F-03's `end` used the array form of `$transaction`; the interactive form is required now because the writer reads before it writes. Behaviour is the same.
- Logging stays in the feature services: the writer does not know whether it runs for an admin screen or a request.
- `assertCoveredByMembership` for an `ADD_MEMBER` coordinator row inside a request must see a `MEMBER` row added earlier **in the same request**; it does, because the applier runs both on the same `tx` in item order.

**Verify**: `membership.writer.spec.ts` and `director.writer.spec.ts` carry F-03 / F-06's existing service cases moved over (overlap, coverage, end-not-earlier, inactive group, disabled user). The F-03 and F-06 service specs shrink to delegation + DTO mapping. `grep -rn "subjectGroupMember.create\|programDirectorAssignment.create" src/features` is empty. `pnpm test -- subject-group program-director membership director` passes. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

`routing-planner.ts`: `academicOfficeStep` replaces its inline `RoleAssignment` query with `db.user.findMany({ where: academicOfficeHoldersWhere(today), select: { id: true } })`.

| Call site of the inline active-R1 query | After this deliverable |
|---|---|
| `RoutingPlanner.academicOfficeStep` (F-13 BE-07) | migrated to `academicOfficeHoldersWhere` |
| `ApprovalRecorder.actionableRows` (this deliverable) | new caller via `isAcademicOfficeHolder` |
| `RequestNotifier.arrived` / `commented` at level 3 (BE-07) | new caller |

`ChangeRequestDetailReader`: `RequestActionsDto` gains `canApprove`, `canReturn`, `canReject` (computed with `recorder.actionableRows(prisma, request, access.userId, today)`; `canApprove` also false for a data request at level 3), `canOverride` (BE-05) and `canComment` (BE-06). `ApprovalStepDto` gains `performedBy`, `isOverride`, `kind` (select `performedBy: { select: { id, fullName } }`).

**Rationale**: The transaction shape mirrors F-13's `SubmissionService.submit` (`f-13-…:2053-2089`): conditional `updateMany` claim first, every check under it, a throw rolls everything back. The recorder is shared for the same reason `StaleChecker` is (`f-13-…:1965`): F-15's final approval records the level-3 row with it. The controller is a second class on the same `change-requests` path, like F-13's `ChangeRequestDocumentsController`; its routes all have a `:id/` prefix plus a literal, so registration order against F-13's `:id` does not matter.

**Gotchas**
- `actionableRows` is read **after** the claim. Read before it, the second of two concurrent coordinators would still see the first one's row PENDING and never advance.
- Under PostgreSQL READ COMMITTED, the blocked `updateMany` re-checks its `where` against the committed row: if the first decision moved the status, the second gets `REQUEST_STATE_CHANGED`; if it did not (level still waiting), the second proceeds and sees the first's row decided.
- `SELF_APPROVAL` comes before `NOT_YOUR_STEP`: a creator calling the route gets the specific refusal (KB-052) even though their own rows were skipped and so are not actionable.
- `FINAL_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` is checked before the transaction; Return and Reject at level 3 work for every type.
- The applier throws inside the transaction; the claim, the rows and any item applied before the failing one roll back together.
- `StaleChecker` for an `ORGANIZATION` request compares each `END_*` item's `oldValue.validTo` with the live row (F-13 BE-07); a row ended by an admin since submit is stale and refused with `STALE_BASE`.
- Level 1/2 approval never returns `COMPLETE`: the level-3 row is never skipped (F-13 BE-07 gotcha).
- `findVisibleRequest` is F-13's helper (404 when not visible); an R5 of another group gets 404, not 403.
- `ClosingAction` = `RETURN | REJECT`; keep it a type alias in `approval.service.ts`.

**Verify**: `approval-rules.spec.ts` — `isActionable` false for an older round, for a level below the status, for a decided row. `approval-recorder.spec.ts` (mocked Prisma) — claim count 0 → `REQUEST_STATE_CHANGED`; record count mismatch → `STEP_ALREADY_DECIDED`; advance with a PENDING row left at level 1 → WAITING; none at 1, one at 3 → NEXT_LEVEL 3 and status `PENDING_ACADEMIC_OFFICE`; none left → COMPLETE; level-3 actionable rows for a non-R1 → empty; creator → empty. `approval.service.spec.ts` — creator → `SELF_APPROVAL`; R5 not an approver → `NOT_YOUR_STEP`; remark passed through; data request at level 3 approve → `FINAL_APPROVAL_REQUIRED`; Return writes RETURN on the caller's rows and status DRAFT with `submissionRound` unchanged; Reject → REJECTED; organisational approve calls the applier before record and closes EFFECTIVE. `organizational-applier.spec.ts` — overlap error from the writer becomes `ORGANIZATION_APPLY_FAILED` with the item label; a non-organisational payload throws. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

**Depends on**: BE-01, BE-03, BE-07 (`RequestNotifier`)

Controller: `@Post(':id/override') @HttpCode(HttpStatus.OK) @RequirePermission(PERMISSIONS.CHANGE_REQUEST_OVERRIDE)`; the method-level decorator replaces the class-level `CHANGE_REQUEST_VIEW` for this route (F-02 `PermissionGuard` reads `getAllAndOverride`). Detail reader: `canOverride = access.has(CHANGE_REQUEST_OVERRIDE) && level ∈ {1, 2} && request.createdById !== access.userId`.

**Rationale**: Same claim → record → advance path as BE-04 so override and normal decisions cannot disagree about when a level completes. `approverId` is never touched (D9): the history shows "should have been X, done by Y" from the same row.

**Gotchas**
- Override at level 1 decides **every** PENDING row of level 1, not one row (US-070 AC1 "cấp đó được tính là đã qua").
- The bypassed approvers get `REQUEST_OVERRIDDEN`; `decided` takes them as `except` so they are not also sent `REQUEST_RETURNED` for the same click.
- R1 who is also the level-1 coordinator of the group and not the creator can use either route; the plain Approve records `isOverride: false` because it was their own row.
- Override at level 3 is refused (`OVERRIDE_LEVEL`): there R1 is the approver and uses BE-04.
- R1's own request → `SELF_APPROVAL` via `decidable` (US-070 AC3).

**Verify**: `approval.service.spec.ts` — override at `PENDING_COORDINATOR` with two PENDING rows → both `isOverride: true`, `performedById` = R1, `approverId` unchanged, status `PENDING_DIRECTOR`, `levelEnteredAt` reset; override RETURN → DRAFT; at `PENDING_ACADEMIC_OFFICE` → `OVERRIDE_LEVEL`; on own request → `SELF_APPROVAL`; reason of 19 characters rejected by the DTO (class-validator `validate`). `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

      orderBy: [{ submissionRound: 'desc' }, { approvalLevel: 'asc' }, { recordedAt: { sort: 'asc', nulls: 'last' } }, { createdAt: 'asc' }],
    });
    const levelNames = await levelNameMap(this.prisma);

```

The step select and step mapper inside F-13's detail reader move to `src/features/change-requests/approval-step.mapper.ts` as `STEP_SELECT` and `toApprovalStepDto`, so the detail reader and the history reader share them; the mapper adds `performedBy`, `isOverride`, `kind: stepKind(step)`. Controller additions: `@Get(':id/history')`, `@Get(':id/comments')`, `@Post(':id/comments') @RequirePermission(PERMISSIONS.CHANGE_REQUEST_COMMENT)` (201). Detail reader: `canComment = access.has(CHANGE_REQUEST_COMMENT)`.

**Rationale**: Reads mirror F-13's detail reader (`f-13-…:1325`): visibility through `findVisibleRequest`, then a plain select. History is its own route because the detail page shows only the current round and older rounds are opened on demand.

**Gotchas**
- A comment by the creator notifies the current approvers; a comment by an approver notifies the creator and the other current approvers; never the author (D14).
- No `PATCH` / `DELETE` route exists; do not add one "for admins" (US-067 AC3).
- `submittedAt` of a round = the earliest `createdAt` of its steps; every step of a round is created in one `createMany`, so they share it.
- Prisma's `nulls: 'last'` ordering needs the `{ sort, nulls }` object form; the shorthand string does not accept it.
- `R6` has no `CHANGE_REQUEST_VIEW`; the class-level permission refuses before visibility is checked.

**Verify**: `comments.service.spec.ts` — not visible → `REQUEST_NOT_FOUND`; a REJECTED request accepts a comment and its status is untouched; whitespace-only content rejected by the DTO; notifier called with the author as actor. `approval-history.reader.spec.ts` — two rounds come back newest first; a skipped row has `kind: SKIPPED`; an override row has `kind: OVERRIDE` with `approver` and `performedBy` different. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

`NotificationQueryDto extends PageQueryDto` with `unread?: boolean` (`@Transform(({ value }) => value === 'true')`, `@IsOptional() @IsBoolean()`) and `pageSize` capped at `NOTIFICATION_PAGE_SIZE_MAX`. `app.module.ts` imports `NotificationsModule`.

**Rationale**: The paged list mirrors F-13's `ChangeRequestsService.list` (`f-13-…:1217-1235`: `$transaction([findMany, count])`, `toSkipTake`, `toPage`). `@AnyAuthenticated()` is F-02's marker for routes every signed-in user may use (`f-02-…:1014`). The writer is shared and generic; the change-request recipient rules sit beside the other shared change-request rules (D19).

**Gotchas**
- `@CurrentUser()` / `AuthenticatedUser` are F-01's; this feature never reads `AccessContext` because it checks no permission.
- Another user's notification id → 404, not 403: existence is not revealed.
- Recipients are computed **after** the rows are recorded: `arrived` for level 2 must see level-2 PENDING rows, which exist since submit.
- `roundApproverIds` includes approvers who already approved at a lower level (US-065 AC3 "người duyệt các cấp trước") and excludes skipped rows, whose `approverId` is the creator or null.
- A pre-existing notification for a request stays readable after the request is withdrawn or rejected; the detail link still resolves for whoever can see the request.
- `ApprovalLevelConfig.levelName` is the configured display name (F-13 BE-01); reading it per notification is one indexed lookup.
- `withdraw`'s `updateMany` gains `levelEnteredAt: null` in `data`; nothing else in it changes.

**Verify**: `notification.service.spec.ts` — duplicate recipients written once; the actor is removed; empty list writes nothing. `request-notifier.spec.ts` (mocked Prisma) — `arrived` at level 3 targets R1 holders minus the creator; `decided` targets the creator and non-skipped approvers minus `except`; `commented` on a REJECTED request targets only the creator. `notifications.service.spec.ts` — another user's id → `NOTIFICATION_NOT_FOUND`; markRead twice → one update; unread filter applied. `submission.service.spec.ts` — submit sets `levelEnteredAt` and calls `arrived` with level 1, or level 3 when levels 1 and 2 are all skipped; withdraw clears `levelEnteredAt`. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

**Depends on**: BE-01, BE-02, BE-04 (`academic-office.ts`, `approval-rules.ts` — build those two files first)

    // Candidates by SQL; "same round, request at this row's level" needs the request's columns, so it is checked in code.
    const named = await this.prisma.approvalStep.findMany({
      where: {
        approverId: access.userId, action: ApprovalAction.PENDING,
        changeRequest: { status: { in: [ChangeRequestStatus.PENDING_COORDINATOR, ChangeRequestStatus.PENDING_DIRECTOR] }, createdById: { not: access.userId }, ...typeFilter },
      },
      select: QUEUE_STEP_SELECT,
    });
    const rows = named.filter((step) => isActionable(step, step.changeRequest));
    const finals = (await isAcademicOfficeHolder(this.prisma, access.userId, today))
      ? await this.prisma.changeRequest.findMany({
        where: { status: ChangeRequestStatus.PENDING_ACADEMIC_OFFICE, createdById: { not: access.userId }, ...typeFilter },
        select: QUEUE_REQUEST_SELECT,
      })
      : [];
    return [...groupByRequest(rows).map((group) => toQueueItem(group, today)), ...finals.map((request) => toFinalQueueItem(request, today))]
      .sort((a, b) => b.daysWaiting - a.daysWaiting || a.requestCode.localeCompare(b.requestCode));
  }
}
```

`groupByRequest` folds a caller's two rows for one request (two groups) into one item whose `standsFor` joins the group or program codes. `toFinalQueueItem` takes `submittedAt` from the request's level-3 step `createdAt` (selected in `QUEUE_REQUEST_SELECT`).

```ts
// src/features/change-requests/approval-queue.controller.ts
@ApiTags('change-requests')
@Controller('approval-queue')
@RequirePermission(PERMISSIONS.CHANGE_REQUEST_VIEW)
export class ApprovalQueueController {
  constructor(private readonly queue: ApprovalQueueReader) {}

  @Get()
  read(@Query() query: ApprovalQueueQueryDto, @CurrentAccess() access: AccessContext): Promise<ApprovalQueueItemDto[]> {
    return this.queue.read(query, access);
  }
}
```

```ts
// src/features/change-requests/change-requests.service.ts — list, inside the AND
...(query.minDaysWaiting && { levelEnteredAt: { lte: subtractDays(todayDate(), query.minDaysWaiting) } }),
```

`ChangeRequestSummaryDto` gains `levelEnteredAt` and `daysWaiting` (`levelEnteredAt ? daysSince(levelEnteredAt) : null`); `REQUEST_SUMMARY_SELECT` gains `levelEnteredAt`. `minDaysWaiting` implies a `PENDING_*` status because only those rows have `levelEnteredAt`.

**Rationale**: A reader class like F-13's `ChangeRequestDetailReader` (`f-13-…:1325`) keeps the service under the size guideline. Default sort is "longest waiting first" (MH-42 "sắp xếp theo số ngày chờ"); the FE table can re-sort client-side because the list is not paged. `daysSince` sits in `src/shared/time/` beside F-03's `todayDate` and `coversDay`.

**Gotchas**
- The queue's `createdById: { not: access.userId }` is belt and braces: the creator's own rows were skipped at submit, so they are not PENDING anyway.
- After a Return, the other approvers' PENDING rows still match the SQL filter only if the request is back in a `PENDING_*` status in a **new** round; `isActionable` drops them on the round check.
- `MS_PER_DAY` and `startOfDay` live with `todayDate` in `src/shared/time/today.ts`; if F-03 did not export `startOfDay`, add it there rather than here.
- `subtractDays(today, n)`: a request entered exactly `n` days ago is included (`lte`), matching "chờ quá N ngày" read as "N ngày trở lên".
- The R1 branch lists every level-3 request in the system, including from other faculties' courses (R1 scope is all, F-02).

**Verify**: `approval-queue.reader.spec.ts` (mocked Prisma) — a PENDING row of round 1 when the request is in round 2 → dropped; a level-2 row while the request is at level 1 → dropped; two rows of one request → one item with both group codes; R1 gets level-3 items not created by them; `requestType` filter passed into both queries; ordering by `daysWaiting` desc. `days-since.spec.ts` — 23:50 yesterday → 1; now → 0. `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json`.

| R5 submits a `SYLLABUS_CONTENT` request; group has one coordinator | coordinator's `GET /approval-queue` lists it with `daysWaiting` 0; R3 of a using program does not see it yet (US-061 AC1) |
| Coordinator approves | status `PENDING_DIRECTOR`; the item leaves the coordinator's queue and appears in the director's (US-063 AC1, US-061 AC4) |
| Group with two coordinators: first approves | still `PENDING_COORDINATOR`; detail steps show one APPROVE and one PENDING (US-063 AC2) |
| Two coordinators approve at the same time (`Promise.all`) | both 200 or one 409 `REQUEST_STATE_CHANGED`; final status `PENDING_DIRECTOR`, never stuck at level 1 |
| Return with a 10-character remark | 400 (KB-047) |
| Return with a valid remark | DRAFT, `submissionRound` 1; creator has an unread `REQUEST_RETURNED` with the remark (KB-048, US-063 AC4) |
| Creator resubmits | round 2, new level-1 rows; history shows two rounds (US-069 AC2) |
| Course in three programs: two directors approve | still `PENDING_DIRECTOR` (US-064 AC2) |
| Third director returns | DRAFT at once (US-064 AC3) |
| R4 of another group calls approve | 404 (not visible) or 403 `NOT_YOUR_STEP` when visible through a program (US-063 AC6) |
| R1 returns at level 3 | DRAFT; creator and level-1/2 approvers notified (KB-049, US-065 AC1, AC3) |
| R1 approves a `SYLLABUS_CONTENT` request at level 3 | 409 `FINAL_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` |
| R1 rejects at level 3 | REJECTED; `POST /submit` → 409 `REQUEST_NOT_DRAFT` (US-065 AC2, US-063 AC5) |
| R5 who is also coordinator submits | level-1 row skipped "Người tạo"; starts at `PENDING_DIRECTOR` (KB-050) |
| R3 submits a curriculum change on own program | level-2 row skipped (KB-051) |
| Creator calls `POST /approve` on own request | 403 `SELF_APPROVAL` (KB-052) |
| R1 overrides level 1 after the coordinator is absent | rows `isOverride`, `performedBy` R1, `approver` the coordinator; status `PENDING_DIRECTOR`; coordinator has `REQUEST_OVERRIDDEN` (KB-053, US-070 AC1) |
| Override with a 5-character reason | 400 (US-070 AC2) |
| R1 overrides own request | 403 `SELF_APPROVAL` (US-070 AC3) |
| `GET /change-requests?minDaysWaiting=3` after moving `levelEnteredAt` back 4 days | lists the request; `minDaysWaiting=5` does not (US-070 AC4) |

The idle test uses a one-minute limit like F-01's manual walk (`f-01-…:2375`) and Vitest fake timers are **not** used: the session store compares real times, so the test sleeps (`vi.useRealTimers`, `await delay(...)`) and is tagged slow.

**Gotchas**
- Moving `levelEnteredAt` back for the backlog test is a direct Prisma update in the test — the only place a test writes a request column directly now that `returnForTest` is gone.
- The concurrency scenario can legitimately return 409 for one call; assert the final state, not both status codes.
- The idle test takes over a minute; keep it in its own `describe` with a raised timeout so the rest of the file stays fast.

**Verify**: `pnpm test:e2e -- approvals notifications change-requests`. `grep -rn returnForTest test src` is empty.

**Depends on**: BE-01..BE-08

### FE-01 — Types, permissions, routes, menu, labels

What/Why: Generated types for every BE-04..BE-08 DTO, two routes, the "Chờ tôi duyệt" and "Thông báo" menu entries (`screen-inventory.md:244`, `:260`), the labels the approval components share; F-13's menu line corrected to F-02's shape (§2c).

**Shape**

```ts
// src/routes.ts — additions
approvalQueue: '/approval-queue',
notifications: '/notifications',

// src/shared/auth/permissions.ts — additions (values from the backend PERMISSIONS)
changeRequestOverride: 'changeRequest.override',
changeRequestComment: 'changeRequest.comment',
```

```tsx
// src/router.tsx — additions, lazy like every feature page
{ path: ROUTES.approvalQueue, element: <RequirePermission code={PERMISSIONS.changeRequestView}><ApprovalQueuePage /></RequirePermission> },
{ path: ROUTES.notifications, element: <NotificationsPage /> },
```

```tsx
// src/shared/layout/menuItems.tsx — APP_MENU; the first line replaces F-13's { key, label, icon, permission } entry
{ path: ROUTES.changeRequests, label: 'Đề xuất thay đổi', permission: PERMISSIONS.changeRequestView },
{ path: ROUTES.approvalQueue, label: 'Chờ tôi duyệt', permission: PERMISSIONS.changeRequestView },
{ path: ROUTES.notifications, label: 'Thông báo' },
```

```ts
// src/features/change-requests/constants/approvalLabels.ts
export const STEP_KIND_LABELS: Record<ApprovalStepKind, string> = {
  NORMAL: '',
  SKIPPED: 'Bỏ qua',
  OVERRIDE: 'Phòng Đào tạo duyệt thay',
};

export const OVERRIDE_ACTION_LABELS: Record<OverrideAction, string> = {
  APPROVE: 'Đồng ý thay',
  RETURN: 'Trả lại thay',
  REJECT: 'Từ chối thay',
};

export const DECISION_TITLES = {
  RETURN: 'Trả lại đề xuất',
  REJECT: 'Từ chối đề xuất',
} as const;

// src/features/change-requests/constants/approvalLimits.ts — mirrored from the backend approval.constants.ts
export const REMARK_MIN = 20;
export const REMARK_MAX = 2000;
export const COMMENT_MAX = 2000;
```

**Rationale**: Same files and order as F-13 FE-01 (`f-13-…:2207-2330`). The menu shape is F-02's `AppMenuItem` (`f-02-…:2330-2343`); `toMenuItems` filters by permission, so "Thông báo" with no permission shows for everyone.

**Gotchas**
- `pnpm api:types` needs the backend running with BE-01..BE-08 in; regenerate before anything in FE-02 compiles.
- F-13's `{ key, label, icon, permission }` line does not type-check against `AppMenuItem`; fixing it here is part of this deliverable, and the F-13 plan is corrected in the same change (DOC-01).
- `ApprovalStepKind` and `OverrideAction` come from the generated schema; do not redeclare the unions.
- `NotificationsPage` has no `RequirePermission`: every signed-in user has notifications, and `RequireAuth` already wraps the layout.

**Verify**: `menuItems.test.tsx` (F-02) gains: a user without `changeRequest.view` sees "Thông báo" and not "Chờ tôi duyệt". `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

**Depends on**: BE-01..BE-08

### FE-02 — API and hooks

What/Why: Typed calls and TanStack Query hooks for decisions, history, comments, queue (feature) and notifications (shared, because the layout's bell uses them).

  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  return useMutation({ mutationFn: markAllNotificationsRead, onSuccess: () => queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: NOTIFICATION_QUERY_ROOT }) });
}
```

`notificationsApi.ts`: `getUnreadCount`, `listNotifications(query)`, `markNotificationRead(id)`, `markAllNotificationsRead()` over `getJson` / `sendJson`, paths `/notifications`, `/notifications/unread-count`, `/notifications/:id/read`, `/notifications/read-all`. Types are aliased from the generated schema in the same file's sibling `src/shared/notifications/types.ts`.

**Rationale**: Feature calls extend F-13 FE-02 (`f-13-…:2333-2466`). Notifications live in `src/shared/` like F-13's `changeRequestQueryRoot.ts`: `AppLayout` is shared code and may not import a feature (F00-02).

**Gotchas**
- `useRequestMutation` was module-private in F-13; exporting it is the only change to its body's file besides the keys.
- `refetchInterval` keeps polling while the tab is hidden only if `refetchIntervalInBackground` is set; leave it unset, so a hidden tab stops polling and a 60-minute idle tab logs out on its next focus refetch.
- A poll answered 401 `SESSION_REQUIRED` goes through F-01's cache-level `handleSessionError` (F-01 D13), which clears `me` and redirects to login; nothing extra here.
- `approve` sends `{ remark: undefined }` → `{}` on the wire; the DTO accepts it.

**Verify**: `useNotifications.test.tsx` — `useUnreadCount` refetches after `NOTIFICATION_POLL_MS` with fake timers; mark-read invalidates the count. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

### FE-03 — Approval panel, remark modal, override

What/Why: MH-41 actions for the current approver and for R1 (US-062 AC4, US-063..US-065, US-070 AC1–AC2); the F-13 detail page placeholder "F-14 adds the approve / return / reject panel" (`f-13-…:2930`).

        <Form.Item
          name="remark"

        </Form.Item>
      </Form>
    </Modal>
  );
}
```

`OverrideModal`: `Form` with `action` (`Radio.Group` over `OVERRIDE_ACTION_LABELS`) and `reason` (same rules as `RemarkModal`), an `Alert` "Phòng Đào tạo quyết định thay cho người duyệt của cấp hiện tại; lịch sử ghi rõ người được thay.", submit through `useOverrideChangeRequest`.

`ChangeRequestDetailPage`: `<ApprovalPanel request={data} />` between `StepProgress` and `DiffView`.

**Rationale**: AntD `Form` with `rules` (F00-04), the modal-form pattern of F-03's `EndMembershipModal` and F-06's director end modal. Buttons come only from `permissions`, the same rule F-13's "Tiếp tục soạn" / "Rút đề xuất" follow: the server decides, the page shows.

**Gotchas**
- `canApprove` is false for a data request at level 3 while `canReturn` / `canReject` are true; F-15 adds the "Chấp thuận cuối" button beside them.
- A 409 `REQUEST_STATE_CHANGED` shows `errorMessage(error)` and refetches the detail (`queryClient.invalidateQueries`), so the buttons that no longer apply disappear.
- A 409 `ORGANIZATION_APPLY_FAILED` lists each `details[].field` (the item label) under the message.
- The validator trims, so 25 spaces do not pass a 20-character minimum.
- The approver's `Popconfirm` has no optional remark field: US-063 asks for none, and the DTO stays ready if one is wanted.

**Verify**: `ApprovalPanel.test.tsx` — all flags false → renders nothing (US-062 AC4, US-067 AC1); a 19-character remark shows the error and sends nothing (KB-047); a 20-character remark posts to `/return`; override form posts `{ action: 'APPROVE', reason }`. `ChangeRequestDetailPage.test.tsx` gains: R1 on a level-1 request sees "Duyệt thay". `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

**Depends on**: FE-02

**Shape**

```tsx
// src/features/change-requests/components/ApprovalHistory.tsx
interface ApprovalHistoryProps { requestId: string; submissionRound: number }

// Loaded only when opened: the current round is already on the page in StepProgress.
export function ApprovalHistory({ requestId, submissionRound }: ApprovalHistoryProps) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useApprovalHistory(requestId, open);
  if (submissionRound === 0) return null;
  return (
    <Collapse
      onChange={(keys) => setOpen(keys.length > 0)}
      items={[{
        key: 'history',
        label: 'Lịch sử phê duyệt',
        children: error ? <ApiErrorResult error={error} /> : isLoading ? <PageSpin /> : (
          <Timeline
            items={data!.rounds.flatMap((round) => [
              { color: 'gray', children: <Typography.Text strong>Lần gửi {round.submissionRound} — {formatDateTime(round.submittedAt)}</Typography.Text> },
              ...round.steps.map((step) => ({ color: STEP_COLORS[step.action], children: <StepLine step={step} /> })),
            ])}
          />
        ),
      }]}
    />
  );
}
```

`StepProgress.tsx`: `StepLine` is exported and gains the override line — when `step.kind === 'OVERRIDE'`, a tag `STEP_KIND_LABELS.OVERRIDE` and "Người duyệt: {approver.fullName} · Thực hiện: {performedBy.fullName}"; `SKIPPED` keeps F-13's grey "Bỏ qua" tag, now read from `STEP_KIND_LABELS`.

```tsx
// src/features/change-requests/components/CommentsCard.tsx
interface CommentsCardProps { requestId: string; canComment: boolean }

export function CommentsCard({ requestId, canComment }: CommentsCardProps) {
  const { data, isLoading } = useComments(requestId);
  const create = useCreateComment(requestId);
  const [form] = Form.useForm<{ content: string }>();
  return (
    <Card size="small" title="Bình luận">
      <List
        loading={isLoading}
        dataSource={data}
        locale={{ emptyText: 'Chưa có bình luận.' }}
        renderItem={(comment) => (
          <List.Item>
            <List.Item.Meta title={`${comment.author.fullName} · ${formatDateTime(comment.createdAt)}`} description={<Typography.Paragraph style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', marginBottom: 0 }}>{comment.content}</Typography.Paragraph>} />
          </List.Item>
        )}
      />
      {canComment && (
        <Form form={form} onFinish={({ content }) => create.mutateAsync(content.trim()).then(() => form.resetFields())}>
          <Form.Item name="content" rules={[{ required: true, whitespace: true, message: 'Nhập nội dung bình luận.' }]}>
            <Input.TextArea rows={3} maxLength={COMMENT_MAX} showCount />
          </Form.Item>
          <Button htmlType="submit" loading={create.isPending}>Gửi bình luận</Button>
        </Form>
      )}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

`ChangeRequestDetailPage`: `ApprovalHistory` below `StepProgress`; `CommentsCard` at the bottom with `canComment={data.permissions.canComment}`.

**Rationale**: `Timeline` grouped by round is MH-41's "lịch sử phê duyệt theo từng lần gửi"; reusing `StepLine` keeps one rendering of a step for the current round and every earlier one. The card + list + form mirrors F-13's `DocumentsCard`.

**Gotchas**
- `STEP_COLORS: Record<ApprovalAction, string>` (`PENDING` gray, `APPROVE` green, `RETURN` orange, `REJECT` red) lives in `approvalLabels.ts`.
- A dead PENDING row of an earlier round (after a Return) shows "Chờ duyệt" in grey with no time; the label "không còn hiệu lực" is added when `round.submissionRound < submissionRound` and `step.action === 'PENDING'`.
- Comments render as plain text (`pre-wrap`), never as HTML.
- No edit or delete control (US-067 AC3).

**Verify**: `ApprovalHistory.test.tsx` — two rounds render newest first with both headers; an override step shows both names; an old-round PENDING row shows "không còn hiệu lực". `CommentsCard.test.tsx` — `canComment` false hides the form; submit posts trimmed content and clears the box. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

Columns: Mã (link to `generatePath(ROUTES.changeRequestDetail, { requestId })`), Tiêu đề, Loại (`REQUEST_TYPE_LABELS`), Cấp (`RequestStatusTag`), Thay mặt (`standsFor ?? '—'`), Người tạo, Ngày gửi (`formatDateTime`), Số ngày chờ (`sorter: (a, b) => a.daysWaiting - b.daysWaiting`, `defaultSortOrder: 'descend'`).

**Rationale**: Mirrors F-13's `ChangeRequestListPage` (`f-13-…:2466-2524`) without paging: the server returns the whole queue already sorted (BE-08).

**Gotchas**
- `useListQuery` keeps the type filter in the URL, so a link "Chờ tôi duyệt?requestType=…" from a later dashboard works.
- After a decision on the detail page, F-13's `useRequestMutation` invalidates the whole `CHANGE_REQUEST_QUERY_ROOT`, which includes the queue key: going back shows the queue without the decided request (US-061 AC4).

**Verify**: `ApprovalQueuePage.test.tsx` — rows render with days waiting; choosing a type requests `?requestType=…`; empty list shows the empty text. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

          footer={<Link to={ROUTES.notifications} onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>Xem tất cả</Link>}

```tsx
// src/shared/notifications/NotificationItem.tsx
interface NotificationItemProps { notification: Notification; onOpen?: () => void }

export function NotificationItem({ notification, onOpen }: NotificationItemProps) {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const markRead = useMarkNotificationRead();
  const unread = notification.readStatus === 'UNREAD';

  async function open() {
    if (unread) await markRead.mutateAsync(notification.id);
    onOpen?.();
    if (notification.changeRequestId) navigate(generatePath(ROUTES.changeRequestDetail, { requestId: notification.changeRequestId }));
  }

  return (
    <List.Item onClick={open} style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
      <List.Item.Meta
        title={<Typography.Text strong={unread}>{notification.content}</Typography.Text>}
        description={formatDateTime(notification.createdAt)}
      />
    </List.Item>
  );
}
```

`AppLayout.tsx`: the header's right side becomes `<Space><NotificationBell /><Dropdown …user menu… /></Space>`.

```tsx
// src/features/notifications/pages/NotificationsPage.tsx
export function NotificationsPage() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useListQuery<NotificationQuery>(NOTIFICATION_LIST_DEFAULTS);
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useNotifications(query);
  const markAll = useMarkAllNotificationsRead();

  if (error) return <ApiErrorResult error={error} />;
  return (
    <PageContainer
      title="Thông báo"
      extra={<Button onClick={() => markAll.mutate()} loading={markAll.isPending}>Đánh dấu tất cả đã đọc</Button>}
    >
      <Segmented
        options={[{ label: 'Tất cả', value: 'all' }, { label: 'Chưa đọc', value: 'unread' }]}
        value={query.unread ? 'unread' : 'all'}
        onChange={(value) => setQuery({ ...query, page: 1, unread: value === 'unread' || undefined })}
      />
      <List
        loading={isLoading}
        dataSource={data?.items}
        renderItem={(notification) => <NotificationItem notification={notification} />}
        pagination={toPagination(data, query, setQuery)}
      />
    </PageContainer>
  );
}
```

**Rationale**: The bell sits in `src/shared/` because `AppLayout` is shared (F00-02); the page is a feature that imports shared code, never the reverse. Header placement extends F-01's `AppLayout` header (`f-01-…:2247-2280`). The page mirrors F-13's list page (`useListQuery`, `toPagination`).

**Gotchas**
- Opening a notification marks it read **before** navigating, so the badge has dropped by the time the detail renders (US-068 AC4).
- `navigate` to a request the user can no longer see lands on F-13's 404 result; the notification stays read.
- The preview query is `enabled` only while the popover is open; only the count polls.
- The `#fff` icon colour matches F-01's header button; if F-01 moved it to a theme token, use the token.
- `Segmented` writes `unread: undefined` for "Tất cả" so the URL carries no `unread=false`.

**Verify**: `NotificationBell.test.tsx` — count 3 shows a badge of 3; a route change triggers a second `unread-count` request; clicking an unread item posts `/notifications/:id/read` and navigates to the detail path. `NotificationsPage.test.tsx` — "Chưa đọc" requests `?unread=true`; "Đánh dấu tất cả đã đọc" posts `read-all`. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

**Depends on**: FE-01, FE-02

### FE-07 — Backlog filter on MH-38

What/Why: US-070 AC4 — R1 lists requests waiting more than N days at their current level.

**Files**

| Action | Path |
|---|---|
| MODIFY | `src/features/change-requests/components/ChangeRequestFilters.tsx` |
| MODIFY | `src/features/change-requests/pages/ChangeRequestListPage.tsx` |
| MODIFY | `src/features/change-requests/pages/ChangeRequestListPage.test.tsx` |

**Shape**

```tsx
// src/features/change-requests/components/ChangeRequestFilters.tsx — addition
<InputNumber
  min={1}
  precision={0}
  addonBefore="Chờ từ"
  addonAfter="ngày"
  value={value.minDaysWaiting}
  onChange={(minDaysWaiting) => onChange({ ...value, page: 1, minDaysWaiting: minDaysWaiting ?? undefined })}
/>
```

`ChangeRequestListPage`: a column "Số ngày chờ" (`daysWaiting ?? '—'`) after Trạng thái.

**Rationale**: The filter joins F-13's existing filter bar (`f-13-…:2511`); the list endpoint already carries the filter (BE-08).

**Gotchas**
- Available to everyone who sees the list, not only R1: it filters only what the caller may already see, and approvers use it too.
- `addonBefore` / `addonAfter` on `InputNumber` are deprecated in AntD 6 in favour of `Space.Compact`; Rule 13 — check the installed AntD 6 API and use `Space.Compact` with plain text if the props are gone.

**Verify**: `ChangeRequestListPage.test.tsx` gains: entering 3 requests `minDaysWaiting=3`; a pending row shows its days. `pnpm exec tsc -b`.

**Depends on**: FE-02

## 6. Sequencing

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  BE01 --> BE02
  BE01 --> BE03 --> BE04
  BE02 --> BE07
  BE04 --> BE07 --> BE05
  BE07 --> BE06
  BE04 --> BE08
  BE05 & BE06 & BE08 --> BE09
  BE09 --> FE01 --> FE02
  FE02 --> FE03 & FE04 & FE05 & FE06 & FE07
  FE03 & FE04 & FE05 & FE06 & FE07 --> DOC01
```

Build order: BE-01 → BE-02 → BE-03 → **pause P1** → BE-04 (shared `academic-office.ts`, `approval-rules.ts` first) → BE-07 → BE-04 (rest) → BE-05 → BE-06 → BE-08 → BE-09 → **pause P2** → FE-01 → FE-02 → FE-03 → FE-04 → **pause P3** → FE-05 → FE-06 → FE-07 → DOC-01.

| Pause | Demoable | Check |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Nothing new on screen; F-03 member and F-06 director screens behave as before; a session idle past the limit is refused | F-01, F-03, F-06 specs and e2e suites green after the writer move and the guard change — both touch code every later feature relies on |
| P2 | The whole approval API and notifications through Swagger | `test/approvals.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/notifications.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/change-requests.e2e-spec.ts` green; KB-047..KB-053 by hand in Swagger |
| P3 | Approve, return, reject, override from the detail page; history and comments | NT-B4-04 by hand as R5 → R4 → R3 → R1 (return at level 3), resubmit, round 2 in the history |

## 7. Verification strategy

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| Backend unit | `authenticated.guard`, `membership.writer`, `director.writer`, `approval-rules`, `approval-recorder`, `organizational-applier`, `approval.service`, `comments.service`, `approval-history.reader`, `notification.service`, `request-notifier`, `notifications.service`, `approval-queue.reader`, `days-since`, `submission.service` specs; F-03 and F-06 service specs re-run |
| Backend e2e | `test/approvals.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/notifications.e2e-spec.ts`, `test/change-requests.e2e-spec.ts`; F-03, F-06 e2e suites re-run (writer move) and F-01's (guard change) |
| Frontend unit | `menuItems.test.tsx`, `useNotifications.test.tsx`, component and page tests of FE-03..FE-07 |
| Build gate | build-verifier agent on both projects |
| Manual walk | NT-B4-04, NT-B4-05 (approval half), NT-B4-07, NT-B4-08; MH-41, MH-42, MH-04 and the bell as R1..R5; a tab left open 61 minutes with the bell polling ends on the login page |
| Test cases | `docs/planning/test-plan.md` KB-047..KB-053 |

## 8. Risks and open items

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| The writer move touches F-03 and F-06's write paths | A changed error code or a lost check breaks the admin screens | Codes kept by spreading the shared constants; pause P1 re-runs both features' suites before any approval code lands |
| The guard change touches every authenticated request | A wrong idle comparison logs everyone out, or never | Unit cases at 59 / 61 minutes and the missing-value case; the e2e idle test at a one-minute limit |
| Concurrent decisions on one request | A level stuck with every row approved | The claim serialises deciders; the e2e concurrency scenario asserts the final status |
| `levelEnteredAt` and the status drift apart if a later write path moves the status without the recorder | Wrong days waiting, a request missing from the backlog filter | Every status move into or out of `PENDING_*` goes through `ApprovalRecorder` or F-13's submit / withdraw (BE-07 call-site table); a new path must use the recorder |
| Notification volume | One row per recipient per event; a busy year is tens of thousands of rows | Index `(recipientId, readStatus, createdAt)`; retention is a later decision, nothing deletes rows today |
| The bell polls every minute per open tab | Load grows with open tabs | One indexed `count`; a hidden tab stops polling (FE-02) |
| AntD 6 `InputNumber` addons | Deprecated props | Rule 13 at FE-07 |
| **Constraint for F-15:** final approval | Data requests at level 3 answer `FINAL_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` | F-15's final-approval route records the level-3 row through `ApprovalRecorder` (`claim`, `actionableRows`, `record`), re-checks `StaleChecker`, moves the request to `APPROVED` with `close`, notifies with `RequestNotifier.approved`, and sets `canFinalApprove` in `RequestActionsDto`; `FINAL_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` stays as the answer of the plain approve route |
| **Constraint for F-15:** activation | `APPROVED → EFFECTIVE` must notify like every other transition | The activation job calls `ApprovalRecorder.close(…, EFFECTIVE)` (clears `levelEnteredAt`) and `RequestNotifier.approved` on the same transaction as the release, so a re-run job finds nothing to do and sends nothing twice |
| **Constraint for F-15:** discarding copies | A request closed by Reject (here) keeps its working copy | F-15 decides whether `REJECTED` / `WITHDRAWN` copies are deleted (F-13 `WorkingCopyService.discard`); until then they stay, read-only through `REQUEST_NOT_DRAFT` |
| **Constraint for F-15:** recipients | F-15 may be tempted to compute its own recipients | Use `RequestNotifier`; add a method there for any new event (D19) |
